<summary>This is a C# desktop application for managing blood bank donor information. From a security perspective, the attack surface appears minimal as it's a standalone desktop app that primarily interfaces with a local MS SQL Server database. No explicit network-facing components or remote APIs are mentioned in the documentation. The key features (user management, authentication, donor management, and dashboard) appear to be completely local. The only external connection mentioned is the database connection string configuration, which typically connects to a local or network SQL Server instance.</summary>
