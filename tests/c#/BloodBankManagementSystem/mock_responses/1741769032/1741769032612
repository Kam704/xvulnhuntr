First examining Program.cs which shows this is a WinForms app starting with frmSplash. 2.Need to examine frmSplash to identify potential remote entry points and risky function calls. 3.Since this appears to be a desktop app connecting to a database, need to check database connection initialization in frmSplash. 4.Also need to check if frmSplash loads any remote resources like images or config files. 5.Looking for any network listeners, remote API calls or web functionality but need more context.",    "analysis": "Initial analysis of Program.cs shows this is a Windows Forms desktop application that starts with a splash screen form (frmSplash).
