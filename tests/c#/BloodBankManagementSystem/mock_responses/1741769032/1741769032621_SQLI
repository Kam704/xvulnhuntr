While the readme suggests database connectivity, there is no immediate evidence of remotely exploitable vulnerabilities in the main program entry point. To properly assess potential SQL injection and other vulnerabilities, we need to examine the frmSplash class and any subsequent forms or classes it may load that handle user input and database operations.",    "poc": "None",    "confidence_score": 0,    "vulnerability_types": [],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "frmSplash",            "reason": "This is the initial form loaded by the application.
