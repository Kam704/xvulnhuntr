Reviewed Program.cs and frmSplash.cs to understand application flow. 2.Program.cs launches frmSplash as main entry point. 3.frmSplash runs a timer animation then launches frmLogin form. 4.No direct evidence of network listeners or remote input processing yet. 5.Need to examine frmLogin and any subsequent forms that handle user authentication and database operations to identify potential SQLI entry points.",        "analysis": "Based on the available code, this is a Windows Forms desktop application that starts with a splash screen (frmSplash) which then loads a login form (frmLogin). While the README mentions database connectivity, the current code path shows no evidence of network listening capabilities or remote input processing. To properly assess for SQL injection and other remote vulnerabilities, we need to examine the login form and any database interaction code it triggers.",    "poc": "None",    "confidence_score": 0,    "vulnerability_types": [],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "frmLogin",            "reason": "Need to examine the login form code to identify potential SQL injection vectors in authentication logic",            "code_line": "frmLogin login = new frmLogin();"        }    ]}
