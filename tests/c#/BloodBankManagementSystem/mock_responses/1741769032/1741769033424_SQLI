Traced code flow: Program.cs -> frmSplash.cs -> frmLogin.cs. 2.Identified potential SQLI entry point in frmLogin.cs where user input from txtUsername.Text and txtPassword.Text flows into loginDAL.loginCheck(). 3.Need to analyze loginDAL.loginCheck() to confirm if user input is directly concatenated into SQL query. 4.Current code shows local Windows Forms desktop app with no direct network listening capabilities. 5.Additional context needed to confirm SQLI: loginBLL class for any input validation and loginDAL class to see how SQL queries are constructed.",    "analysis": "Initial code analysis reveals a potential SQL injection vulnerability in the login form where username and password from text inputs are passed unchecked to loginDAL.loginCheck(). However, full vulnerability confirmation requires examination of the loginDAL and loginBLL classes to understand input validation and SQL query construction. The application appears to be a local Windows Forms app with no direct network attack surface, which would typically limit remote exploitation. However, any SQL injection vulnerability could potentially be exploited if the application were exposed via remoting or if the login form were modified to accept remote input in a future version.",    "poc": "None - Cannot construct reliable PoC without seeing SQL query construction in loginDAL class",    "confidence_score": 3,    "vulnerability_types": ["SQLI"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "loginBLL",            "reason": "Need to examine any input validation or sanitization of username/password before database operations",            "code_line": "loginBLL l = new loginBLL();"        },        {            "name": "loginDAL",            "reason": "Need to examine SQL query construction in loginCheck method to confirm SQLI vulnerability",            "code_line": "bool isSuccess = dal.loginCheck(l);"        }    ]}
