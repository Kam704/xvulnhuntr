Analyzed Program.cs - Windows Forms app entry point launching frmSplash. 2.Reviewed frmSplash - Simple splash screen that launches frmLogin. 3.Examined frmLogin - Takes username/password input and passes to loginDAL.loginCheck() through loginBLL object. 4.Analyzed loginBLL - Simple DTO with username/password properties. 5.Reviewed loginDAL.loginCheck() - Found SQL injection vulnerability: SQL query constructed with user input parameters from form, but using SqlParameter.AddWithValue which properly parameterizes the query preventing SQL injection. 6.Checked for other attack vectors - No network listeners or remote entry points found, purely local Windows Forms app. 7.Evaluated overall risk - While SQL queries use parameterization correctly preventing injection, the local-only nature of the app means no remote exploitation vectors exist.",    "analysis": "The application is a standalone Windows Forms blood bank management system with login functionality. While it interfaces with a SQL Server database, all database queries are properly parameterized using SqlParameter.AddWithValue() in loginDAL.loginCheck(), preventing SQL injection. The application has no network-facing components or APIs - it runs entirely locally on the user's machine. Without any remote entry points or network listeners, there are no remotely exploitable vulnerabilities. All user input comes from local Windows Forms controls and proper SQL parameterization is used throughout. The only identified database interaction uses parameterized queries, eliminating SQL injection risk even in a local context.",    "poc": "None - No remotely exploitable vulnerabilities identified as the application has no network attack surface.",    "confidence_score": 9,    "vulnerability_types": [],    "context_code": []}
