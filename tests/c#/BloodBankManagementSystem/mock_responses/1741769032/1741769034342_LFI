So far, no remotely exploitable vulnerabilities have been identified as there are no network-facing components or file operations in the reviewed code. To complete the security assessment, particularly for potential LFI vulnerabilities, we need to examine the frmLogin implementation as it may contain database connections, file operations, or network functionality that could introduce security risks.",    "poc": "None",    "confidence_score": 0,    "vulnerability_types": [],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "frmLogin",            "reason": "Login form may contain file operations, network calls, or database connections that could introduce LFI vulnerabilities",            "code_line": "frmLogin login = new frmLogin();"        }    ]}
