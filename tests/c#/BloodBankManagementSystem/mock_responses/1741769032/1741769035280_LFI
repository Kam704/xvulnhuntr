Analyzing Program.cs - only shows standard WinForms startup code, launching frmSplash. 2.Checking frmSplash - simple splash screen that auto-transitions to frmLogin after animation. 3.Examining frmLogin - handles user authentication but no file operations. 4.Reviewing loginDAL - uses parameterized SQL queries for auth, no file operations. 5.Looking at loginBLL - simple model class with username/password properties. 6.No file operations or path handling found in any provided code. 7.Application appears to be a standard desktop WinForms app with no exposed network endpoints or remote attack surface. 8.Login validation uses parameterized queries which prevents SQL injection. 9.No user-controlled file paths or names found that could lead to LFI.",    "analysis": "After reviewing the provided code, I found no evidence of Local File Inclusion vulnerabilities. The application is a desktop WinForms program with no exposed network endpoints or remote attack surface. The only external interaction is with a local SQL Server database, which uses parameterized queries for credential validation. There are no file operations or path handling functions that accept user input. The application follows a standard WinForms architecture with form-to-form navigation and local authentication.",    "poc": "None - No LFI vulnerability discovered",    "confidence_score": 3,    "vulnerability_types": [],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "frmHome",            "reason": "Need to check if home form contains any file operations or path handling that could lead to LFI",            "code_line": "frmHome home = new frmHome();"        }    ]}
