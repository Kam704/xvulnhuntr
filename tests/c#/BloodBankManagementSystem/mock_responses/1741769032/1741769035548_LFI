Analyzed Program.cs - main entry point that launches splash screen. 2.Analyzed frmSplash - Simple form with timer that transitions to login form. 3.Analyzed frmLogin - Basic login form with username/password validation. 4.Analyzed loginDAL - Handles database authentication with parameterized queries. 5.Analyzed loginBLL - Simple user model class. 6.Analyzed frmHome - Main application interface with no file operations. 7.No remote network listeners or exposed endpoints found. 8.No file path handling or inclusion functions identified. 9.No user-controlled file operations discovered.",    "analysis": "After thorough analysis of the provided code, I found no viable Local File Inclusion vulnerabilities. The application is a standard C# WinForms desktop program without any network-exposed components that could enable remote exploitation. The only external interaction is with a local SQL Server database using parameterized queries. The application follows typical desktop application patterns with form-to-form navigation and does not implement any file inclusion or path handling functionality that accepts user input. While the application does read a connection string from configuration, this is handled by the .NET framework's configuration system and is not exposed to remote user input.",    "poc": "None - No LFI vulnerability identified",    "confidence_score": 0,    "vulnerability_types": [],    "context_code": []}
