Initial code review of main.go shows setup of an Echo web framework server with several key components: config loading, logger initialization, repository setup, session management, and router initialization. 2.The application serves static files via middleware.StaticContentsMiddleware which could be a potential LFI vector. 3.Repository setup with database access could indicate SQLI risks. 4.Need to examine router.Init() to understand API endpoints and input handling. 5.Session management implementation needs review for security issues. 6.Need to check middleware implementations for security controls. 7.Static file serving from embedded files needs verification of path traversal protections.",    "analysis": "Initial analysis of main.go reveals several potential vulnerability areas: 1) Static file serving through middleware.StaticContentsMiddleware could be vulnerable to path traversal/LFI if not properly secured 2) Database operations through repository.NewBookRepository may have SQLI vectors 3) Session management implementation could have security flaws 4) Router initialization may expose vulnerable endpoints. To properly assess these, we need to examine the implementation of key components, particularly the router setup and middleware handlers.", "poc": "None - Need implementation details of router and middleware to construct proof of concept",    "confidence_score": 3,    "vulnerability_types": ["LFI", "SQLI"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "router.Init",            "reason": "Need to examine API endpoint setup and input handling",            "code_line": "router.Init(e, container)"        },        {            "name": "middleware.StaticContentsMiddleware",            "reason": "Need to verify path traversal protection in static file serving",            "code_line": "middleware.StaticContentsMiddleware(e, container, staticFile)"        },        {           "name": "repository.BookRepository",            "reason": "Need to examine SQL query construction and input handling",            "code_line": "rep := repository.NewBookRepository(logger, conf)"        }    ]}
