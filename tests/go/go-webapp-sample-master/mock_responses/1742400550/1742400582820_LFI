Examining main.go for LFI vulnerabilities: a) Found embedded files using go:embed - Inspecting usage of staticFile embed.FS. b) The staticFile is used in middleware.StaticContentsMiddleware - need to examine this implementation. c) Other embedded files (yamlFile, zapYamlFile, propsFile) appear to be used only for configuration loading - less likely vectors for LFI. 2.Key areas for investigation: a) StaticContentsMiddleware implementation - this could expose file contents. b) Router initialization via router.Init() - need to see route handlers. c) Custom file operations in middleware package. 3.Need to see implementation of: a) middleware.StaticContentsMiddleware to understand file serving logic. b) router.Init to identify potential file-related endpoints.",    "analysis": "Initial analysis of the main.go file reveals potential LFI concerns around the static file serving functionality. The code embeds static files and uses them in middleware.StaticContentsMiddleware, but we need to see the implementation to determine if there are path traversal or LFI vulnerabilities. The application serves content on port 8080 and uses the Echo web framework, which has built-in path sanitization, but custom implementations could bypass these protections. Without seeing the middleware implementation, we cannot determine if proper path validation is in place.",    "poc": "None",    "confidence_score": 2,    "vulnerability_types": ["LFI"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "middleware.StaticContentsMiddleware",            "reason": "Need to examine how static files are served and if path traversal protections are implemented",            "code_line": "middleware.StaticContentsMiddleware(e, container, staticFile)"        },        {            "name": "router.Init",            "reason": "Need to check route handlers for potential file-related endpoints that could be vulnerable to LFI",            "code_line": "router.Init(e, container)"        }    ]}
