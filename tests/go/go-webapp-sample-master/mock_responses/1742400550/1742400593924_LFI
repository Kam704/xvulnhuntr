Examining main.go, found static file serving via StaticContentsMiddleware and embed.FS. 2.StaticContentsMiddleware implementation shows use of Echo's static file middleware with echomd.StaticWithConfig. 3.Config shows Root:resources/public and HTML5:true indicating SPA-style routing. 4.Filesystem uses http.FS wrapper around embed.FS which provides safe access. 5.Router.Init is clean and only sets up standard controllers. 6.No direct file access APIs visible in current code. 7.Embedded files prevent direct LFI via path traversal. 8.Need to see more controller code to verify no indirect file access is exposed via APIs.",    "analysis": "Based on the code provided, I do not see any direct LFI vulnerabilities. The application uses Go's embed.FS feature which is explicitly designed to prevent path traversal and file system access outside the embedded files. The static file serving is implemented using Echo's built-in middleware with proper configuration (Root is explicitly set, Browse is false). The http.FS wrapper provides additional safety against path traversal attempts. However, to be thorough, I need to examine the various controllers (book, category, format, account) to verify there are no indirect file access capabilities exposed via APIs that could lead to LFI.",    "poc": "None - current code paths do not show exploitable LFI vulnerabilities",    "confidence_score": 6,    "vulnerability_types": ["LFI"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "controllers.BookController",            "reason": "Need to verify if book operations involve any file access or path manipulation",            "code_line": "setBookController(e, container)"        },        {            "name": "controllers.AccountController",            "reason": "Need to check for profile picture uploads or other file-related functionality",            "code_line": "setAccountController(e, container)"        }    ]}
