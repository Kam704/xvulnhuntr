Started by examining main.go for high-risk file operations. Identified static file serving via middleware.StaticContentsMiddleware. 2.Reviewed StaticContentsMiddleware implementation - uses Echo's secure static file server with embed.FS. 3.Checked router.Init to understand exposed endpoints - need to examine BookController and AccountController for file operations. 4.Current code shows no direct file operations but need to examine controllers fully. 5.Need to see setBookController and setAccountController implementations to verify if there are any file operations tied to user input.",        "analysis": "The main application appears to use secure file serving mechanisms through Echo's middleware and Go's embed.FS, which are designed to prevent path traversal. However, to complete the LFI vulnerability analysis, I need to examine how the book and account controllers are set up and whether they implement any file operations that could be manipulated by user input. The current code shows proper security controls for static file serving but requires investigation of the controller implementations to verify there are no indirect file access capabilities.",        "poc": "None identified yet - need controller implementations to verify absence of file operations",        "confidence_score": 3,        "vulnerability_types": ["LFI"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "router.setBookController",            "reason": "Need to examine how book-related endpoints are configured and if they involve any file operations",            "code_line": "setBookController(e, container)"        },        {            "name": "router.setAccountController",            "reason": "Need to examine how account-related endpoints are configured and if they involve any file operations",            "code_line": "setAccountController(e, container)"        }    ]}
