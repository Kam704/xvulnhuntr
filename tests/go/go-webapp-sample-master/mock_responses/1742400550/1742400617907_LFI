Examining main.go and provided context code for LFI vulnerabilities. 2.Found StaticContentsMiddleware which serves static files from embedded FS (embed.FS) - this is secure against path traversal by design. 3.Need to check controller implementations for Book and Account operations to verify if they have any file operations. 4.Router shows standard REST API routes but need to examine actual controller implementations. 5.Will request Book and Account controller implementations to check for file operations that could be manipulated.",    "analysis": "The current code uses secure methods for serving static files via Echo's middleware and Go's embed.FS. The StaticContentsMiddleware implementation correctly uses the embed.FS filesystem which provides safe access to embedded files and prevents directory traversal attacks. However, to complete the LFI vulnerability analysis, I need to examine the implementations of BookController and AccountController to verify if they contain any file operations that could be manipulated by user input. The current router setup shows standard REST API endpoints, but without seeing the controller implementations, I cannot rule out potential file operations that might be vulnerable to LFI.",    "poc": "None - Need to examine controller implementations first",    "confidence_score": 3,    "vulnerability_types": ["LFI"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "controller.NewBookController",            "reason": "Need to examine the Book controller implementation for any file operations that could be manipulated",            "code_line": "book := controller.NewBookController(container)"        },        {            "name": "controller.NewAccountController",            "reason": "Need to examine the Account controller implementation for any file operations that could be manipulated",            "code_line": "account := controller.NewAccountController(container)"        }    ]}
