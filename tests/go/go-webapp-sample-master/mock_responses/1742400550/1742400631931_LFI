Analyzed main.go which shows Flask-like web app using Echo framework. 2.Examined StaticContentsMiddleware which uses secure embed.FS for static files. 3.Reviewed router setup showing standard REST endpoints. 4.Need to examine controller implementations to verify if there are any file operations that could be vulnerable to LFI. 5.From context code: StaticContentsMiddleware uses Echo's secure static file serving with embed.FS which prevents directory traversal. 6.Need to examine BookController and AccountController implementations to see if they perform any file operations that could be manipulated.",    "analysis": "Initial analysis shows the application uses Echo framework's secure static file serving via embed.FS in StaticContentsMiddleware, which provides strong protection against directory traversal and LFI attacks for static content. However, to complete the LFI vulnerability analysis, I need to examine the actual implementations of the Book and Account controller methods to verify if they contain any file operations that could be manipulated through user input. The router setup shows standard REST API endpoints, but without seeing the full controller implementations, I cannot yet rule out potential file operations that might be vulnerable to LFI.",    "poc": "None - Need controller implementations to verify potential file operations",    "confidence_score": 3,    "vulnerability_types": ["LFI"],    "context_code": [{        "name": "bookController.GetBook,bookController.CreateBook,bookController.UpdateBook,bookController.DeleteBook",        "reason": "Need to examine book controller methods for file operations that could be vulnerable to LFI",        "code_line": "book := controller.NewBookController(container)"    },    {        "name": "accountController.GetLoginStatus,accountController.GetLoginAccount,accountController.Login,accountController.Logout",        "reason": "Need to examine account controller methods for file operations that could be vulnerable to LFI",        "code_line": "account := controller.NewAccountController(container)"    }]}
