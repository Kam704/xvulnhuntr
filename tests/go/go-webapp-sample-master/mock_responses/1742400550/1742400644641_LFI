Examined main.go and middleware/router setup. File serving uses echo's secure StaticWithConfig middleware with embed.FS which prevents directory traversal. 2.Reviewed all controller implementations in context_code. Account controller only handles session management, no file operations. 3.Book controller implementation shows only basic CRUD operations without file handling. 4.StaticContentsMiddleware is properly configured with HTML5 mode and browse disabled. 5.Config loading uses embed.FS for application.yml and messages.properties which prevents tampering. 6.No user-controllable file paths or indirect file inclusions found in any controller methods. 7.All file operations are done through embed.FS which provides strong isolation from the filesystem.",    "analysis": "The application appears to be secure against LFI vulnerabilities. All file operations are handled through Go's embed.FS feature which provides a secure, isolated filesystem abstraction. The StaticContentsMiddleware is properly configured using echo.StaticWithConfig with security best practices including: disabled directory browsing, HTML5 mode for SPA support, and a restricted root path. Configuration files are also loaded through embed.FS preventing tampering. No controllers implement custom file operations or accept user input that could influence file paths. The session management and book CRUD operations work purely with database records rather than files.",    "poc": "None - No viable LFI vulnerabilities were identified. The application's use of embed.FS and proper static file middleware configuration prevents common LFI attack vectors.",    "confidence_score": 8,    "vulnerability_types": [],    "context_code": [{        "name": "service.NewBookService,service.BookService",        "reason": "Need to verify if book service implements any file operations",        "code_line": "return &bookController{container: container, service: service.NewBookService(container)}"    }]}
