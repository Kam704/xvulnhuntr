Examined main.go and identified use of embed.FS for static files and configuration 2.Analyzed StaticContentsMiddleware which uses echo's built-in static file serving with secure defaults 3.Reviewed router.Init and controller setup - no direct file operations found 4.Checked BookController and AccountController implementations - operate on database records only 5.Examined config loading which uses embed.FS 6.Overall architecture uses embed.FS pattern correctly which prevents path traversal 7.No user input is used for file paths or names 8.No custom file operation methods found in provided code 9.Static content serving is properly sandboxed to resources/public directory",        "analysis": "The application appears to be secure against LFI vulnerabilities. File operations are exclusively handled through Go's embed.FS feature which provides an isolated filesystem abstraction. The StaticContentsMiddleware uses echo.StaticWithConfig with security best practices including: disabled directory browsing, HTML5 mode, and a restricted root path. Configuration files are loaded through embed.FS preventing tampering. No controllers implement custom file operations or accept user input that could influence file paths. Book and account operations work with database records rather than files. The static file serving is properly sandboxed to the resources/public directory.",    "poc": "None - No LFI vulnerability identified as all file operations use embed.FS which prevents path traversal and directory traversal attacks.",    "confidence_score": 9,    "vulnerability_types": [],    "context_code": []}
