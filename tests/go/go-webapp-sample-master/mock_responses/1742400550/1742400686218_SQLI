Looking at entrypoints: main.go shows usage of Echo web framework for routing and handling HTTP requests. Gorm ORM is used for database access (repository.NewBookRepository). 2.Need to examine router initialization at router.Init() to find API endpoints and request handlers. 3.Need to analyze BookRepository code to check for unsafe SQL construction that could allow injection. 4.Looking at middleware: session management, logging, and static file handling are setup in middleware package - need details. 5.Repository layer handles database operations - critical to analyze how SQL queries are constructed and executed.",    "analysis": "Initial review of main.go indicates this is an Echo web application using Gorm ORM for database access. The key areas for potential SQL injection are in the repository layer accessed via repository.NewBookRepository. While Gorm generally provides SQL injection protection through parameterized queries, we need to analyze the actual query construction in the BookRepository implementation to identify any raw SQL usage or unsafe dynamic query building that could enable SQL injection. Without seeing the router and repository implementation code, cannot make definitive vulnerability assessment.",    "poc": "None - Need repository implementation code to develop specific PoC",    "confidence_score": 2,    "vulnerability_types": ["SQLI"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "router.Init",            "reason": "Need to examine API endpoint handlers to identify user input entry points",            "code_line": "router.Init(e, container)"        },        {            "name": "repository.NewBookRepository",             "reason": "Need to analyze database query construction for SQL injection risks",            "code_line": "rep := repository.NewBookRepository(logger, conf)"        }    ]}
