Identified main entry points in book.go controller interface showing CRUD operations that likely interact with database. 2.The application uses GORM ORM which provides SQL injection protection by default through parameterized queries. 3.However, need to see concrete implementations of controller methods to verify how user input is processed and passed to GORM. 4.Need to trace complete path from controller endpoint handlers to repository layer database operations. 5.Current code shows basic structure but missing key controller implementations where SQL injection could occur. 6.Repository layer shows basic GORM setup but need to see how queries are constructed. 7.Request additional context for controller implementations to complete analysis.",    "analysis": "Initial review of the codebase shows a Go web application using Echo framework and GORM ORM. While GORM provides built-in SQL injection protection through parameterized queries, the actual implementations of the controller methods that process user input and construct database queries are not visible. The BookController interface defines CRUD operations that interact with the database, but without seeing the concrete implementations, cannot definitively assess SQL injection risks.
