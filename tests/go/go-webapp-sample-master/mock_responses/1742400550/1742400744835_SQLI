Reviewing main components and flow: - Echo web framework for HTTP routing - GORM ORM for database operations - Book management CRUD operations via REST API. 2.Current visible attack surfaces: - Book API endpoints with user-controlled input (GetBook, CreateBook, UpdateBook, DeleteBook) - ID parameter in DeleteBook endpoint - Title search parameter in FindBooksByTitle service method. 3.Analysis of input handling: - DeleteBook controller passes raw ID parameter to service layer - FindBooksByTitle takes raw title input for search - Repository layer uses GORM but implementation details not visible. 4.Potential injection points: - Need to see how service.DeleteBook and service.FindBooksByTitle construct queries - Need to examine repository layer query construction. 5.Missing critical code paths: - service.bookService implementation - repository query building and execution logic - model.Book struct definition and GORM tags.",    "analysis": "Initial code review reveals potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in the book management API endpoints, particularly in the DeleteBook and FindBooksByTitle operations where user input is accepted. While GORM generally provides SQL injection protection through parameterized queries, we need to examine the actual service and repository implementations to confirm proper input handling. Critical code paths in the service and repository layers are not visible, making it impossible to definitively confirm or rule out SQL injection risks. Need to see implementation details for how user input is transformed into database queries.",    "poc": "None - Cannot construct reliable PoC without seeing service and repository implementations",    "confidence_score": 3,    "vulnerability_types": ["SQLI"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "service.bookService",            "reason": "Need to see how DeleteBook and FindBooksByTitle handle user input",            "code_line": "service BookService interface { ...
