Identified entry points - web API endpoints in BookController for CRUD operations. 2.Traced data flow: HTTP params/body -> controller -> service -> repository -> GORM DB operations. 3.Found SQL operations use GORM ORM with model structs. 4.DeleteBook and FindBooksByTitle accept user input. Need to analyze FindBooksByTitle implementation since it may allow SQL injection through title search. 5.Current code shows proper GORM usage which generally prevents SQL injection through parameterization, but need FindBooksByTitle implementation to confirm. 6.Request service.bookService.FindBooksByTitle to analyze search query construction.",    "analysis": "The application uses the GORM ORM framework which generally provides SQL injection protection through parameterized queries. The main risk areas are the book search and delete operations that accept user input. While GORM's model-based queries are safe by default, we need to analyze the actual implementation of FindBooksByTitle to confirm there's no raw SQL usage or unsafe query construction. The DeleteBook operation appears safe as it uses GORM's standard Delete method with proper ID parameter handling. However, without seeing the FindBooksByTitle implementation, cannot fully rule out SQL injection risks in the search functionality.",    "poc": "None - Need implementation of FindBooksByTitle to develop proof of concept",    "confidence_score": 5,    "vulnerability_types": ["SQLI"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "service.bookService.FindBooksByTitle",            "reason": "Need to analyze how the title search query is constructed to check for SQL injection risks",            "code_line": "FindBooksByTitle(title string, page string, size string) (*model.Page, error)"        }    ]}
