Entry Points: Book search by title, Book deletion. 2.Code Flow: Search - title param -> FindBooksByTitle (service) -> FindByTitle (model). Delete - id param -> DeleteBook (service) -> Delete (model). 3.SQL Operations: Uses GORM ORM but need to see FindByTitle implementation to confirm no raw SQL. 4.Input Handling: Title search param used in FindByTitle model method but implementation not visible. Delete uses parameterized GORM Delete. 5.Security: GORM provides SQL injection protection by default but need FindByTitle code to confirm no raw SQL usage. 6.Need model.Book.FindByTitle implementation to complete analysis.",        "analysis": "The application uses the GORM ORM framework for database operations. While reviewing the book search and delete functionality, DeleteBook appears safe as it uses GORM's parameterized Delete method. However, the critical FindByTitle method implementation in the Book model is not visible in the provided code. This method processes user-supplied title search input and needs inspection to confirm it uses GORM's safe query builders rather than raw SQL. Without seeing the FindByTitle implementation, cannot definitively rule out SQL injection risks in the search functionality.",        "poc": "None",        "confidence_score": 5,        "vulnerability_types": ["SQLI"],        "context_code": [        {            "name": "model.Book.FindByTitle",            "reason": "Need to inspect the title search query implementation to confirm no raw SQL usage",            "code_line": "result, err := book.FindByTitle(rep, title, page, size)"        }    ]}
