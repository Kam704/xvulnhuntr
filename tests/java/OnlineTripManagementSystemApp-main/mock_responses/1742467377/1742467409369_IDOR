Examining FeedbackController.java for IDOR vulnerabilities: - Found multiple endpoints using IDs (/Feedback/find/{feedbackId}, /Feedback/find/{key}/{customerId}, etc) - Key parameter suggests some form of authentication but need to verify implementation - Need to check FeedbackService to understand authorization logic 2.Key concerns: - Direct object access via feedbackId without apparent authorization - Customer feedback access via customerId that could allow accessing other users' data - Admin-only operations like viewAllFeedbacks may be accessible to regular users 3.Need to examine: - FeedbackService implementation to understand authorization checks - Feedback model to understand data exposure - Any authentication/authorization service implementation",    "analysis": "Based on initial code review, there are potential IDOR vulnerabilities in the FeedbackController endpoints. While a 'key' parameter is used suggesting some authentication mechanism, several endpoints allow direct access to feedback records via IDs without clear authorization checks at the controller level. The findByFeedbackId endpoint is particularly concerning as it doesn't require a key parameter and could allow unauthorized access to any feedback by ID. To confirm the vulnerabilities and provide accurate exploitation steps, we need to examine the service layer implementation.",    "poc": "Initial IDOR test cases (pending service layer verification): 1. Access arbitrary feedback: GET /Feedback/find/123 2. Access other user's feedback: GET /Feedback/find/key123/789 where 789 is another user's customerId 3. Admin functionality bypass: GET /Feedback/findAllFeedback/invalidkey",    "confidence_score": 5,    "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "FeedbackService",            "reason": "Need to examine service layer authorization checks and feedback access control implementation",            "code_line": "@Autowired private FeedbackService feedbackService;"        },        {            "name": "Feedback",            "reason": "Need to understand feedback data model and any built-in access controls",            "code_line": "public ResponseEntity<Feedback> addFeedback(@RequestBody Feedback feedback,@PathVariable(\"key\") String key)"        }    ]}
