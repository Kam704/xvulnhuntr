Analyzing FeedbackController endpoints: a)POST /Feedback/add/{key}: Requires authentication key b)GET /Feedback/find/{feedbackId}: Direct access by ID without auth c)GET /Feedback/find/{key}/{customerId}: Access by customer ID with key d)GET /Feedback/findAllFeedback/{key}: View all with key. 2.Examining auth controls: a)addFeedback: Has key parameter but need to see implementation b)findByFeedbackId: No auth check at controller level c)findByCustomerId: Has key but need implementation d)viewAllFeedbacks: Has key parameter. 3.Checking Feedback model: Simple entity with ID, feedback text, rating, date and user relation. 4.Need to examine FeedbackServiceImpl to understand auth implementation. 5.Key findings so far: a)findByFeedbackId endpoint allows direct access without auth b)Other endpoints use key param but actual validation unknown c)Potential IDOR risk in customerId access.",    "analysis": "Based on the code review of FeedbackController and related components, there is a confirmed IDOR vulnerability in the /Feedback/find/{feedbackId} endpoint. This endpoint allows direct access to any feedback record by ID without requiring authentication or authorization. The endpoint is publicly accessible and the controller passes the ID directly to the service layer without any access control checks. This could allow attackers to enumerate and access feedback records belonging to any user in the system. While other endpoints include an authentication key parameter, the /find/{feedbackId} endpoint is completely unprotected. We need FeedbackServiceImpl implementation to confirm if there are additional IDOR vulnerabilities in the other endpoints, but the findByFeedbackId vulnerability is confirmed at the controller level.",    "poc": "1. Send GET request to /Feedback/find/1 to access feedback ID 1\n2. Increment ID systematically: /Feedback/find/2, /Feedback/find/3 etc\n3. No authentication required, allowing enumeration of all feedback records\nExample curl command:\ncurl -X GET http://target.com:8888/Feedback/find/1",    "confidence_score": 8,    "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "FeedbackServiceImpl",            "reason": "Need to examine the service implementation to confirm if there are additional IDOR vulnerabilities in the authenticated endpoints",            "code_line": "@Autowired private FeedbackService feedbackService;"        }    ]}
