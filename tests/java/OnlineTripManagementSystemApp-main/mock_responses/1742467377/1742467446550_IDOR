Examined FeedbackController class - all public REST endpoints for feedback management. 2.Found /Feedback/find/{feedbackId} endpoint allows direct access to any feedback by ID without authentication. 3.Examined FeedbackService interface - only method signatures available. 4.Checked Feedback model - confirms feedbackId is primary key, has user relationship. 5.Need FeedbackServiceImpl to confirm if any authorization checks exist in service layer. 6.Currently have proof of unauthenticated access to /find/{feedbackId}. 7.Other endpoints require 'key' parameter but need implementation to verify if proper authorization checks exist.",    "analysis": "The FeedbackController exposes a critical IDOR vulnerability in the /Feedback/find/{feedbackId} endpoint. This endpoint allows direct, unauthenticated access to any feedback record by ID. Unlike other endpoints that require an authentication key parameter, this endpoint has no authentication requirement at the controller level. The Feedback model shows that feedback records are associated with specific users through a ManyToOne relationship, meaning this endpoint could expose private feedback from any user in the system. While other endpoints include an authentication key parameter, we need the FeedbackServiceImpl implementation to verify if proper authorization checks prevent users from accessing other users' feedback through those endpoints.",    "poc": "GET /Feedback/find/1 - Directly access feedback ID 1 without authentication\nGET /Feedback/find/2 - Access feedback ID 2\n...etc\nBy incrementing the feedbackId parameter, an attacker can enumerate and access all feedback records in the system without authentication or authorization.",    "confidence_score": 8,        "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR"],    "context_code": [{        "name": "FeedbackServiceImpl",        "reason": "Need implementation to verify if any authorization checks exist in service layer and to confirm if other endpoints are also vulnerable to IDOR",        "code_line": "@Autowired private FeedbackService feedbackService;"    }]}
