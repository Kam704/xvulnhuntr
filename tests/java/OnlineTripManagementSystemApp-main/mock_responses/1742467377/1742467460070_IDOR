Reviewed FeedbackController endpoints and authorization patterns. 2.Found /Feedback/find/{feedbackId} lacks any authentication. 3.Analyzed Feedback model showing user relationship. 4.Other endpoints require key parameter but actual authorization checks unknown. 5.Need FeedbackServiceImpl to verify if proper access controls exist in service layer. 6.Without service layer implementation, can't verify if key validation actually prevents unauthorized access. 7.Based on controller alone, direct object reference vulnerability exists due to unauthenticated feedback ID access. 8.Need to verify authorization in service layer implementation.",    "analysis": "The FeedbackController exposes an unauthenticated endpoint /Feedback/find/{feedbackId} that allows direct access to feedback records by ID without any authentication or authorization checks at the controller level. While other endpoints require an authentication key parameter, the findByFeedbackId method notably omits this requirement, potentially allowing unauthorized access to any feedback in the system. The Feedback model confirms that feedback records are tied to specific users through a ManyToOne relationship, making this a concerning privacy issue. Without seeing the FeedbackServiceImpl code, we cannot confirm if there are any authorization checks at the service layer that might mitigate this vulnerability.",    "poc": "GET /Feedback/find/1234 - No authentication required, directly accesses feedback ID 1234\nGET /Feedback/find/1235 - Can iterate through IDs to access all feedback\nThis allows unauthorized access to view private feedback from any user in the system.",    "confidence_score": 7,    "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "FeedbackServiceImpl",            "reason": "Need to verify if service layer implements proper authorization checks for feedback access",            "code_line": "@Autowired private FeedbackService feedbackService;"        }    ]}
