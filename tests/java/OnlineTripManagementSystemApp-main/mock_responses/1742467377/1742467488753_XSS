Examining FeedbackController.java which handles feedback functionality. 2.Controller maps several HTTP endpoints like /Feedback/add/{key} and /Feedback/find/{feedbackId}. 3.The controller takes and returns Feedback objects, need to examine Feedback model to look for XSS vector points. 4.No obvious XSS sanitization in controller code but data may be sanitized in service layer or model. 5.Need to examine FeedbackService and Feedback model to understand input processing. 6.@CrossOrigin(origins = '*') allows requests from any domain which increases XSS risk. 7.Feedback object is directly returned in responses which could allow XSS if it contains unsanitized input.",    "analysis": "The FeedbackController exposes several REST endpoints that handle Feedback objects. The key security concerns are: 1. @CrossOrigin with wildcard origin allows requests from any domain. 2. Direct reflection of user input via Feedback objects in responses. 3. No visible XSS sanitization at the controller level. However, to confirm XSS vulnerabilities, we need to examine how the Feedback model is structured and if any sanitization occurs in the service layer. The critical path for potential XSS is through the POST /Feedback/add/{key} endpoint where user input is stored and then retrieved via GET endpoints. Need to examine Feedback model and service implementation to confirm if user input is properly sanitized before storage and output.",    "poc": "None - Need to examine Feedback model and service implementation to construct valid PoC",    "confidence_score": 4,    "vulnerability_types": ["XSS"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "Feedback",            "reason": "Need to examine Feedback model structure and any input validation/sanitization",            "code_line": "@RequestBody Feedback feedback"        },        {            "name": "FeedbackService",            "reason": "Need to examine service layer implementation for input processing and sanitization",            "code_line": "@Autowired private FeedbackService feedbackService;"        }    ]}
