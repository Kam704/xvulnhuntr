Analyzing feedback input flow: POST /Feedback/add/{key} takes Feedback object containing feedbackString which is user-controlled. 2.Found Feedback model with unsanitized String feedbackString field. 3.Examining service layer interface shows no sanitization methods. 4.GET endpoints reflect stored feedback data directly in responses. 5.@CrossOrigin allows requests from any domain, enabling XSS payload delivery. 6.Need FeedbackServiceImpl to confirm if any sanitization occurs during processing. 7.Current code shows user input -> database storage -> direct reflection pattern but missing service implementation to confirm full path.",    "analysis": "Based on the code review, there is a potential Stored XSS vulnerability in the feedback submission and retrieval flow. The FeedbackController accepts user input via the feedbackString field in the Feedback model through the /Feedback/add/{key} endpoint. This string is stored unsanitized in the database and later retrieved and reflected in responses through multiple GET endpoints. The @CrossOrigin annotation with wildcard origin ('*') allows the XSS payload to be triggered from any domain. However, to confirm the complete attack path and absence of sanitization, we need to examine the FeedbackServiceImpl class that implements the FeedbackService interface.",    "poc": "1.
