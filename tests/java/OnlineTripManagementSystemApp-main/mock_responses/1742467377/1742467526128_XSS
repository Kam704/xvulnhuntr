Analysis of FeedbackController shows multiple endpoints handling user input and responses. 2. Key endpoint /Feedback/add/{key} accepts Feedback object with feedbackString field from user input. 3. @CrossOrigin(origins='*') allows requests from any domain. 4. No apparent input sanitization in controller layer. 5. Feedback model shows feedbackString stored as raw String. 6. Multiple GET endpoints reflect stored feedback content. 7. Need FeedbackServiceImpl to verify if any sanitization occurs in service layer and understand complete flow. 8. Current findings suggest stored XSS via unsanitized feedback submission and reflection.",    "analysis": "The code reveals a potential Stored XSS vulnerability in the feedback submission and retrieval flow. The primary attack vector is through the /Feedback/add/{key} endpoint which accepts a Feedback object containing user-controlled feedbackString content. This content appears to be stored unsanitized in the database and is later reflected through multiple GET endpoints like /Feedback/find/{feedbackId} and /Feedback/findAllFeedback/{key}. The @CrossOrigin annotation with '*' allows the XSS payload to be triggered from any origin. While we have visibility of the controller layer and model, confirming the complete vulnerability requires examining the FeedbackServiceImpl to verify absence of sanitization in the service layer.",    "poc": "1.
