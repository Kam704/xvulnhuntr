Analyzing FeedbackController endpoints: POST /Feedback/add/{key} takes user submitted Feedback object and GET endpoints expose feedback data. 2.Feedback model shows feedbackString is stored as plain String with no sanitization annotations. 3.@CrossOrigin('*') allows requests from any origin. 4.Need to verify sanitization in service layer to confirm full code path. 5.FeedbackService interface exposes methods but need implementation details. 6.Will request FeedbackServiceImpl to trace handling of user input.",    "analysis": "Based on code analysis, there is a potential Stored XSS vulnerability in the feedback submission and retrieval flow. The FeedbackController exposes endpoints that accept and return user-controlled content through the feedbackString field. Key factors: 1) The POST endpoint stores raw user input 2) Multiple GET endpoints reflect this stored content 3) No visible sanitization in controller or model layers 4) @CrossOrigin('*') allows cross-origin access 5) Need FeedbackServiceImpl to confirm absence of sanitization in service layer. The attack vector would involve submitting malicious JavaScript in feedbackString that gets stored and later reflected to other users.",    "poc": "1.
