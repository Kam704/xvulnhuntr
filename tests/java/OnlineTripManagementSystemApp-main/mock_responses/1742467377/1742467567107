  Analyzing TravelController.java - REST controller with CRUD endpoints. 2. Entry points identified: POST /travels/{key}, PUT /travelsUpdate/{key}, DELETE /travelsDelete/{travelId}/{key}, GET /travelsSearch/{travelId}, GET /travelsList. 3. @CrossOrigin(origins='*') indicates potential CORS issues. 4. Key injection points: path variables (key, travelId) and request body (Travel object). 5. Service layer calls through tService need inspection. 6. No visible input validation/sanitization. 7. Need to examine Travel model and TravelService implementation for vulnerability sinks. 8. IDOR risk identified due to direct ID access in endpoints.",    "analysis": "The TravelController exposes several REST endpoints with concerning security patterns: 1) Unrestricted CORS allowing requests from any origin 2) Direct object references via travelId parameter 3) No visible input validation on path variables or request body 4) Potentially sensitive operations (create/update/delete) protected only by a 'key' parameter. Without examining the Travel model and service implementation, there are clear IDOR risks as the endpoints directly expose object IDs. Authorization appears to rely solely on a key parameter which could be vulnerable to brute force or prediction attacks. The Travel object deserialization from request body could potentially lead to injection vulnerabilities depending on the model implementation.",    "poc": "IDOR Exploitation Steps: 1. Enumerate valid travel IDs via GET /travelsList 2. Access individual records via GET /travelsSearch/{travelId} by iterating through IDs 3. Attempt to modify/delete other users' records via PUT/DELETE endpoints by manipulating travelId parameter 4. For key parameter, implement brute force or try common/predictable values",    "confidence_score": 6,    "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "Travel",            "reason": "Need to examine model class for potential injection points and sensitive data exposure",            "code_line": "@RequestBody Travel travel"        },        {            "name": "TravelService",            "reason": "Need to inspect service implementation for authorization checks and input validation",            "code_line": "@Autowired private TravelService tService"        }    ]}
