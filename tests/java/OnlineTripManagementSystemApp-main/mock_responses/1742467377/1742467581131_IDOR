Examining TravelController class for IDOR vulnerabilities. 2.Found multiple endpoints that use ID/key parameters without visible authorization: /travels/{key}, /travelsUpdate/{key}, /travelsDelete/{travelId}/{key}, /travelsSearch/{travelId}, /travelsList. 3.Key endpoints take a 'key' parameter but its validation isn't visible. 4.TravelId parameter is used directly without apparent authorization checks. 5.Need to examine TravelService to understand authorization implementation. 6.CrossOrigin annotation allowing all origins (*) increases attack surface. 7.Need to see Travel model to understand what sensitive data might be exposed.",    "analysis": "The TravelController class exhibits potential IDOR vulnerabilities through several concerning patterns: 1) Direct object references via travelId parameter without visible authorization checks 2) Unclear validation of the 'key' parameter used for operations 3) The /travelsSearch/{travelId} endpoint allows direct lookup of travel records by ID without any visible access control 4) The /travelsList endpoint returns all travels without apparent filtering or access control. Additional analysis of TravelService implementation is needed to confirm if proper authorization is implemented at the service layer. The @CrossOrigin(origins = '*') annotation increases the exposure of these potential IDOR vulnerabilities by allowing access from any origin.",    "poc": "1.
