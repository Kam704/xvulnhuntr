Analyzing TravelController endpoints: - POST /travels/{key} - PUT /travelsUpdate/{key} - DELETE /travelsDelete/{travelId}/{key} - GET /travelsSearch/{travelId} - GET /travelsList. 2.Checking authentication/authorization: - 'key' parameter used but no visible validation - Direct access to travelId resources with no user context checks. 3.Evaluating TravelService: - Interface only, need implementation to confirm authorization. 4.Examining Travel model: - Contains sensitive business data (agent details, address, contact). 5.Security concerns identified: - @CrossOrigin(origins = '*') allows access from any domain - No user context validation visible in controller - Direct object lookup via ID without access control - Need to check TravelServiceImpl for authorization.",    "analysis": "Based on code analysis, there are multiple IDOR vulnerabilities in the TravelController. The key issues are: 1) The /travelsSearch/{travelId} endpoint allows direct lookup of Travel records by ID without any authentication or authorization checks. 2) The /travelsList endpoint exposes all Travel records without filtering based on user context. 3) While the other endpoints use a 'key' parameter, there's no visible validation of this key or user context checking. 4) The @CrossOrigin(origins = '*') annotation compounds these issues by allowing access from any domain. The Travel model contains sensitive business data including agent details and contact information, making these IDOR vulnerabilities particularly concerning.",    "poc": "1.
