Examining TravelController and provided context: TravelController exposes REST endpoints for managing travel records. 2.@CrossOrigin(origins='*') allows requests from any domain. 3.Found 2 unauthenticated endpoints: /travelsSearch/{travelId} and /travelsList. 4.Need TravelServiceImpl to understand key validation for other endpoints. 5.Travel model shows sensitive data exposed: agent details, contact info, addresses. 6.Analyzing authentication: key parameter used in some endpoints but no visible validation. 7.Need more context on how key validation works in service layer. 8.Found critical IDOR: direct object reference via travelId without authorization checks. 9.API allows unrestricted access to all travel records.",        "analysis": "The code contains multiple confirmed IDOR vulnerabilities. The most critical issues are: 1) The /travelsSearch/{travelId} endpoint allows direct lookup of Travel records by ID without any authentication, exposing sensitive business data including agent details and contact information. 2) The /travelsList endpoint provides unfiltered access to all Travel records without authorization. 3) While other endpoints use a 'key' parameter, its validation is unclear without the service implementation. The @CrossOrigin(origins='*') annotation compounds these issues by allowing access from any origin. The Travel model reveals that exposed data includes sensitive fields like agent names, contact numbers and addresses.",        "poc": "IDOR Exploit Steps: 1. Enumerate travel IDs by calling /travelsSearch/{id} with sequential numbers (1,2,3...) 2. No authentication required, so direct GET request works: curl -X GET 'http://target:8888/travelsSearch/1' 3. Extract sensitive data from response including agent details and contact info 4. For bulk data extraction: curl -X GET 'http://target:8888/travelsList' 5. Payload can be automated to dump all records into local database",        "confidence_score": 8,        "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR"],        "context_code": [        {            "name": "TravelServiceImpl",            "reason": "Need to verify if key validation and authorization checks exist in service layer",            "code_line": "@Autowired private TravelService tService;"        }    ]}
