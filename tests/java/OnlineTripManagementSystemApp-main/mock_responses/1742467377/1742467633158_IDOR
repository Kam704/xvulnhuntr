Examining TravelController which exposes several REST endpoints for managing travel records. 2.Notice @CrossOrigin(origins='*') allowing requests from any domain/origin. 3.Two endpoints of concern - /travelsSearch/{travelId} and /travelsList - allow direct access to travel records without authentication. 4.Other endpoints use a 'key' parameter but need to verify its validation. 5.Travel model shows sensitive data exposed including agent details, contact info, addresses. 6.To complete analysis,need TravelServiceImpl to verify authorization checks. 7.Currently confirmed that /travelsSearch and /travelsList endpoints have IDOR as they access data by ID without auth checks.",        "analysis": "Two high-severity IDOR vulnerabilities confirmed in TravelController: 1) /travelsSearch/{travelId} endpoint allows direct lookup of Travel records by ID with no authentication required, exposing sensitive business data including agent details, contact info and addresses. 2) /travelsList endpoint provides unfiltered access to all Travel records without any authorization checks. These endpoints combined with @CrossOrigin(origins='*') create serious exposure. The Travel model confirms sensitive data fields being exposed. While other endpoints use a 'key' parameter, further analysis of TravelServiceImpl is needed to verify its authorization implementation.",        "poc": "Exploit 1 (Search by ID): curl -X GET http://target-host:8888/travelsSearch/1 # Retrieves travel record with ID 1 including sensitive agent data. Exploit 2 (List all): curl -X GET http://target-host:8888/travelsList # Retrieves all travel records with sensitive data.
