Analyzing TravelController: The controller exposes multiple endpoints for travel management with varying authorization schemes. 2.Examining authorization: Some endpoints require a 'key' parameter but two critical endpoints (/travelsSearch/{travelId} and /travelsList) do not require any authentication. 3.@CrossOrigin(origins='*') allows unrestricted cross-origin access. 4.Inspected Travel model: Contains sensitive fields including agentName, address, contact info. 5.Analyzing access controls: Need TravelServiceImpl to verify if any authorization checks exist at service layer. 6.IDOR vulnerability confirmed in serchTravels() and viewTravels() methods which directly expose Travel records without verification.",    "analysis": "Two critical IDOR vulnerabilities are confirmed in the TravelController. First, the /travelsSearch/{travelId} endpoint allows any unauthenticated user to directly access Travel records by ID with no authorization checks. Second, the /travelsList endpoint provides complete access to all Travel records in the system without authentication. These endpoints expose sensitive business data including agent names, contact information and addresses. The @CrossOrigin(origins='*') annotation compounds the issue by allowing access from any origin. While other endpoints implement a 'key' parameter for authorization, these two endpoints completely bypass access controls. The Travel model confirms the sensitivity of exposed data including agent details and contact information.",    "poc": "IDOR Exploit 1: Send GET request to /travelsSearch/1 to access any travel record by ID without authentication. Response will contain sensitive agent and contact details. IDOR Exploit 2: Send GET request to /travelsList to dump all travel records in the system. This provides complete visibility of all travel agent data without authorization.",    "confidence_score": 9,    "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "TravelServiceImpl",            "reason": "Need to verify if any authorization checks exist in service layer implementation",             "code_line": "@Autowired private TravelService tService;"        }    ]}
