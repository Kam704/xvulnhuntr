Identified remote API entry points: /signup, /login, /logout, /profile, /delete, /appoint. All exposed via REST API over HTTP. 2.User input in UserDTO, User models needs checking for validation/sanitization. 3.Key security concerns: userLogin() auth bypass, deleteUser() IDOR via userid, makeUserAdmin() code check bypass. 4.@CrossOrigin(origins='*') indicates potential XSS risk. 5.Need service layer code to trace user input flow through auth and data access layers. 6.Requesting both User and UserDTO models to check data validation. 7.Need UserAuthenticationServices implementation to analyze auth flow.",    "analysis": "Initial security analysis of UserController reveals several potential vulnerabilities: 1) IDOR risk in deleteUser() endpoint where userid parameter could be manipulated to delete other users' accounts if authorization is improperly implemented. 2) XSS risk due to permissive CORS policy with origins='*'. 3) Authorization bypass potential in appointNewAdmin() if passcode validation is weak. 4) Possible IDOR in updateUser() if proper user context verification isn't performed. To complete the analysis, need to examine the service layer implementation and model validations.",    "poc": "Potential IDOR exploit for /delete endpoint: 1) Authenticate as regular user to get authKey 2) Send DELETE request to /user/delete?userid=<admin_id>&authKey=<obtained_key> 3) If authorization checks are insufficient, could delete admin account.
