Examining UserController.java, found multiple endpoints that could be vulnerable to IDOR: /delete and /profile update. 2.Delete endpoint takes userid parameter directly which is concerning. 3.Need to examine service layer to verify authorization checks. 4.Update endpoint accepts User object directly which could allow parameter manipulation. 5.Need to see UserAuthenticationServices implementation to verify IDOR protections. 6.Checking the code paths, I need to see how authentication token (authKey) is validated and how user authorization is enforced. 7.Cross-origin is set to * which increases attack surface but not directly related to IDOR. 8.Request full implementation of service layer classes and User model.",    "analysis": "Initial analysis indicates potential IDOR vulnerabilities in both the delete and update user endpoints. The delete endpoint (/user/delete) takes a userid parameter which could be manipulated to delete other users' accounts if proper authorization isn't enforced. The update endpoint (/user/profile) accepts a full User object which could potentially be manipulated to update other users' data. While authentication tokens are used (authKey parameter), we need to verify the actual implementation of authorization checks in the service layer. The makeUserAdmin endpoint is particularly concerning as it could enable privilege escalation if email parameter validation is insufficient.",    "poc": "Potential IDOR exploitation (pending service layer verification):\n1. Login as normal user to get valid authKey\n2. Send DELETE request: /user/delete?userid=<other_user_id>&authKey=<valid_token>\n3. Send PUT request to /user/profile with modified User object containing another user's ID\n4.
