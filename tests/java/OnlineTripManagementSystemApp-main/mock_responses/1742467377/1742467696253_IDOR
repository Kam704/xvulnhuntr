Examining UserController.java - Found DELETE endpoint /user/delete taking userid and authKey parameters. 2.Examining update endpoint /user/profile accepting full User object without explicit auth check in controller. 3.Checking UserAuthenticationServices interface - shows service layer methods but need implementation to verify authorization. 4.Looking at User model - reveals full user data structure with sensitive fields. 5.Need to see UserAuthenticationServices implementation to verify authorization checks. 6.Concerning that updateUser() only takes User object without separate auth param. 7.deleteUser() has authKey but need to verify it enforces proper access control. 8.makeUserAdmin() endpoint takes email/passcode with no obvious auth check.",    "analysis": "Multiple potential IDOR vulnerabilities identified: 1. The /user/profile PUT endpoint accepts a complete User object without any userid validation in the controller. While authentication may occur in service layer, the User object contains the userId field which could potentially be manipulated to update other users' data. 2. The /user/delete endpoint takes a userid parameter that could be manipulated if service layer authorization is insufficient. 3. The /user/appoint endpoint for making users admin appears to lack proper authorization controls at the controller level. To confirm these vulnerabilities and their exploitability, we need to examine the UserAuthenticationServices implementation to verify the authorization checks.",    "poc": "1.
