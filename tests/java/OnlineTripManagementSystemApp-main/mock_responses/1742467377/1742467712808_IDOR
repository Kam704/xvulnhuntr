Analyzing user profile update endpoint /user/profile - Accepts complete User object including userId. Need to verify authorization checks in service implementation. 2.Examining /user/delete endpoint - Takes userId parameter that could be manipulated. Need to verify admin-only access control. 3.Reviewing /user/appoint admin endpoint - Takes email parameter which could potentially be used to escalate any user to admin. 4.Need UserAuthenticationServicesImpl to verify authorization implementations and confirm vulnerabilities. Looking at provided code: User model shows userId is primary key generated by system. But profile update accepts full User object with no validation in controller of whether authenticated user matches userId being updated. Delete endpoint takes userid parameter separately from auth key with no validation in controller. Appoint admin endpoint only checks a passcode but no admin verification in controller.",    "analysis": "Multiple IDOR vulnerabilities likely present due to lack of proper authorization controls at controller level, though final confirmation requires service implementation review. Most critical is the profile update endpoint that accepts a complete User object including userId field - this could allow updating any user's profile by manipulating the userId. The delete endpoint accepts userId as a parameter which could be manipulated to delete other users if service layer checks are insufficient. The admin appointment endpoint appears to rely solely on a passcode without proper role validation, potentially allowing privilege escalation. While some checks may exist in service layer, absence of authorization in controller creates significant risk.",    "poc": "1. Profile Update IDOR: Send PUT request to /user/profile with valid auth token but modified userId in request body to target another user's profile. 2. User Delete IDOR: Send DELETE request to /user/delete with valid auth token but userid parameter of another user. 3. Admin Escalation: Send POST to /user/appoint with email of target user to escalate to admin if passcode is discovered/bruteforced.",    "confidence_score": 7,    "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR"],    "context_code": [{        "name": "UserAuthenticationServicesImpl",        "reason": "Need to verify actual authorization implementation in service layer",        "code_line": "@Autowired UserAuthenticationServices service;"    }]}
