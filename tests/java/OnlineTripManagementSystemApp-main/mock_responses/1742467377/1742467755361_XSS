Examined UserController class which handles user authentication and management endpoints. 2.Found @CrossOrigin(origins='*') annotation allowing requests from any domain. 3.Need to trace User model and UserDTO classes to analyze potential XSS vectors in user input fields. 4.Looking for output contexts where user input gets reflected back. 5.Need to examine UserAuthenticationServices implementation to understand input handling. 6.Key endpoints accepting user input: /signup (User object), /login (UserDTO), /profile (User object). 7.User objects likely contain fields that could be vectors for stored XSS.",    "analysis": "The controller exposes several endpoints that accept and store user input via User and UserDTO objects. The @CrossOrigin annotation with origins='*' allows requests from any domain, increasing XSS risk. Without seeing the User/UserDTO models and service layer implementation, we need to verify how user input fields are validated, sanitized and rendered. The /signup, /login and /profile endpoints are particular areas of concern as they handle direct user input that may be stored and reflected back to other users. The service layer implementation is critical to determine if proper output encoding is in place.",    "poc": "None - Need to examine User model and service implementation to construct valid PoC",    "confidence_score": 3,    "vulnerability_types": ["XSS"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "User",            "reason": "Need to examine User model fields that could contain XSS payloads",            "code_line": "@PostMapping(value = '/signup') public ResponseEntity<MessageDTO> userSignUp(@Valid @RequestBody User user)"        },        {            "name": "UserDTO",            "reason": "Need to examine UserDTO model fields that could contain XSS payloads",            "code_line": "@PostMapping('/login') public ResponseEntity<SessionDTO> userSignIn(@Valid @RequestBody UserDTO user)"        },        {            "name": "UserAuthenticationServices",            "reason": "Need to examine service layer implementation for input validation and sanitization",            "code_line": "@Autowired UserAuthenticationServices service;"        }    ]}
