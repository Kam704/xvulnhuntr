Examined UserController with CORS enabled (* origin) 2.Analyzed User model fields for potential XSS injection points - unescaped user input fields like name, address, email 3.Traced input flow: User input in signup/update endpoints > stored in DB > potentially reflected in responses 4.UserAuthenticationServices interface shows the methods but need to see implementation for validation/sanitization 5.Particular concern around name/address fields that could contain HTML/JS and get reflected in responses 6.No output encoding visible in controller responses 7.RequestBody annotations with User model direct binding increases risk 8.Need to see service implementation and any view/templating code to confirm XSS risk",    "analysis": "The code shows several potential XSS vulnerabilities. The User model accepts name and address fields as Strings with minimal validation (@NotBlank, @Size) but no HTML escaping. These fields are accepted via @RequestBody in /signup and /profile endpoints and stored in DB. With CORS fully open (origins=*), malicious cross-origin requests could inject HTML/JS payloads. While input validation exists through annotations, there's no strict HTML sanitization or output encoding visible in the controller responses. The stored user data could be reflected in other parts of the application, enabling stored XSS attacks. However, without seeing the view layer and service implementation showing how this data is ultimately rendered to users, the full exploitability cannot be confirmed.",    "poc": "1. Submit XSS payload via signup: POST /user/signup {\"name\":\"<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>\",\"address\":\"normal\",\"mobile\":\"1234567890\",\"email\":\"test@test.com\",\"password\":\"Pass123\"} 2. If stored and reflected without encoding, payload executes when user data is displayed",    "confidence_score": 6,    "vulnerability_types": ["XSS"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "UserAuthenticationServicesImpl",            "reason": "Need to see service implementation to verify if any sanitization/encoding is performed",            "code_line": "@Autowired UserAuthenticationServices service;"        }    ]}
