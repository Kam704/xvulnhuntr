Examining UserController.java and provided context code focusing on XSS. 2.Controller exposes multiple endpoints accepting user input: /signup (User object), /login (UserDTO), /profile (User object). 3.User model has fields that could contain XSS payloads: name, address. Only basic validation exists (@NotBlank, @Size) but no HTML escaping. 4.CORS is completely open with @CrossOrigin(origins = '*'). 5.User data is persisted via JPA (@Entity) meaning malicious input could be stored. 6.Response entities contain user data that could reflect XSS payloads: new ResponseEntity<User>(user,HttpStatus.OK) in /appoint endpoint. 7.Need to see UserAuthenticationServicesImpl to understand if any sanitization happens at service layer. 8.Need to see how responses are rendered in the frontend to confirm exploitability.",    "analysis": "The code reveals potential stored XSS vulnerabilities due to insufficient input sanitization and HTML escaping. The most critical path is through the /signup and /profile endpoints which accept a User object containing name and address fields with only basic validation (@NotBlank, @Size) but no HTML sanitization. These fields are persisted to the database and later reflected in responses like the /appoint endpoint's ResponseEntity<User>. With CORS completely open (origins='*'), malicious cross-origin requests could inject HTML/JS payloads that would be stored and executed when the data is rendered to other users. However, without seeing the service implementation and frontend rendering code, we cannot confirm if additional protections exist.",    "poc": "POST /user/signup Content-Type: application/json {\"name\":\"<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>\",\"mobile\":\"1234567890\",\"address\":\"123 Main St\",\"email\":\"test@test.com\",\"password\":\"Password1\"} - This payload would be stored in the database if no sanitization exists in the service layer.
