Analyzed UserController.java which exposes API endpoints for user management. 2.Found /signup and /profile endpoints that accept User object with name/address fields. 3.Basic input validation (@NotBlank,@Size) but no HTML sanitization or escaping. 4.Need to see UserAuthenticationServicesImpl to understand response formatting. 5.ResponseEntity<User> from /appoint endpoint suggests User object fields are reflected in responses. 6.CORS wide open with @CrossOrigin(origins='*'). 7.Need frontend code to confirm if output is escaped.",    "analysis": "The code shows potential for XSS due to insufficient sanitization. The User model accepts potentially malicious HTML/JS in name and address fields. While it has size and format validations (@Size, @Pattern), it lacks HTML sanitization. The data is persisted and later reflected in responses via ResponseEntity<User>. With CORS fully open, this enables stored XSS. However, determining full exploitability requires seeing the service implementation and frontend rendering code.",    "poc": "1. POST /user/signup with payload: {\"name\":\"<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>\",\"mobile\":\"1234567890\",\"address\":\"test\",\"email\":\"test@test.com\",\"password\":\"Password1\"} 2. Payload gets stored in database 3. When admin views user via /appoint endpoint, the script executes if frontend renders without escaping",    "confidence_score": 6,    "vulnerability_types": ["XSS"],    "context_code": [{        "name": "UserAuthenticationServicesImpl",        "reason": "Need to see how User objects are processed and formatted in responses",        "code_line": "@Autowired UserAuthenticationServices service;"    }]}
