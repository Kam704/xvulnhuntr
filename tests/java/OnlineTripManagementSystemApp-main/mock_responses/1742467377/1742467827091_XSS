Reviewed UserController endpoints, User model, and UserDTO model. Found inputs in name, address fields of User model that lack HTML sanitization. 2.Checked that @CrossOrigin(origins='*') allows requests from any origin, increasing XSS risk. 3.User signup and update endpoints accept @RequestBody User objects which store the unsanitized input. 4.Name and address fields allow arbitrary strings with only length/pattern validation. 5.Responses are returned via ResponseEntity with stored objects directly. 6.Need to see service implementation to verify any additional sanitization and frontend code to confirm how data is rendered. 7.Requesting UserAuthenticationServicesImpl to verify if any sanitization happens before storage.",    "analysis": "The code contains multiple potential XSS vulnerabilities due to insufficient input validation and sanitization. The User model accepts arbitrary strings in name and address fields with only basic length/format validation but no HTML sanitization. These fields are persisted via signup/update endpoints and later reflected in responses. With CORS fully open via @CrossOrigin(origins='*'), this enables both stored and reflected XSS if the frontend renders this data unsafely. The /signup and /profile endpoints are particularly vulnerable as they accept and store user input directly. However, full confirmation requires seeing the service implementation for any additional sanitization and frontend code for rendering practices.",    "poc": "1.
