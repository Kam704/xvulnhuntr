Found REST API controller for hotel management with CRUD operations. 2.Key entry points: POST /hotel/add/{key}/{packageId}, DELETE /hotel/delete/{hotelId}/{key}, PUT /hotel/update/{key}. 3.Cross-origin requests allowed via @CrossOrigin(origins='*'). 4.User input received via: @RequestBody Hotel object, path variables for key and IDs. 5.Operations depend on HotelService methods which need review. 6.Key authentication parameter suggests possible auth bypass. 7.Direct object reference via hotelId path variable indicates potential IDOR. 8.Need to review Hotel model and HotelService implementation for input validation and DB interactions.",    "analysis": "The HotelController exposes REST endpoints for hotel management with several security concerns: 1) CORS is configured to allow all origins (*) which could enable malicious cross-origin requests. 2) Direct object references via hotelId parameter without visible access control checks suggests IDOR vulnerability. 3) The key parameter appears to be used for authentication but implementation needs review. 4) Hotel object deserializing from JSON request body could enable injection attacks depending on model validation. To complete analysis, need to review Hotel model class for proper input validation and HotelService implementation to understand authentication and access control.",    "poc": "IDOR Proof of Concept: 1) Authenticate as low-privileged user to obtain valid key 2) Send DELETE request to /hotel/delete/123/validkey where 123 is ID of hotel belonging to different user 3) If deletion succeeds without proper authorization check, IDOR is confirmed",    "confidence_score": 6,    "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "Hotel",            "reason": "Need to review model class for input validation and potential injection points",            "code_line": "@RequestBody Hotel hotel"        },        {            "name": "HotelService",             "reason": "Need to review service implementation for authentication and access control",            "code_line": "@Autowired HotelService hotelService"        }    ]}
