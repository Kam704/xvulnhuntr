Examining HotelController.java, focusing on potential IDOR vulnerabilities. 2.Found three endpoints that accept IDs/keys: /hotel/add/{key}/{packageId}, /hotel/delete/{hotelId}/{key}, /hotel/update/{key}. 3.All endpoints use a 'key' parameter which seems to be for authentication/authorization. 4.Need to examine HotelService to understand authorization implementation. 5.DeleteMapping endpoint accepts hotelId directly in URL which could be vulnerable to IDOR. 6.UpdateMapping accepts entire Hotel object which could allow unauthorized modifications. 7.Need to verify authorization checks in service layer before confirming vulnerabilities. 8.Cross-origin is set to '*' which increases attack surface. 9.Need to see how 'key' parameter is validated and how Hotel object access is controlled.",        "analysis": "The HotelController exposes three endpoints that could be vulnerable to IDOR attacks. The most concerning is the /hotel/delete/{hotelId}/{key} endpoint which accepts a hotelId directly in the URL. While there is a 'key' parameter that appears to be for authorization, we need to verify how this is implemented in the service layer. Similarly, the update endpoint accepts a full Hotel object which could allow modification of any hotel if authorization isn't properly enforced. The @CrossOrigin(origins = '*') annotation allows requests from any origin, increasing the attack surface. To confirm these potential IDOR vulnerabilities, we need to examine the HotelService implementation to understand the authorization checks.",        "poc": "None - Need to examine HotelService implementation to confirm bypass potential",        "confidence_score": 5,        "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR"],        "context_code": [        {            "name": "HotelService",            "reason": "Need to examine service layer implementation to understand authorization checks and potential IDOR vulnerabilities",            "code_line": "@Autowired HotelService hotelService;"        },        {            "name": "Hotel",            "reason": "Need to understand Hotel model structure to assess impact of potential IDOR in update/delete operations",            "code_line": "@RequestBody Hotel hotel"        }    ]}
