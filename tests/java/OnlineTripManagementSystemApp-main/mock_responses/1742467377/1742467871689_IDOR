Identified 3 endpoints in HotelController that take object IDs/keys as parameters. 2.@CrossOrigin allows requests from any origin, increasing attack surface. 3.Authorization appears to rely on a 'key' parameter passed to service layer. 4.Need to see HotelServiceImpl to understand authorization checks. 5.Current code shows direct object references via hotelId and full Hotel object modification without visible authorization enforcement. 6.Hotel model shows direct DB mapping which could enable IDOR if authorization is weak. 7.Need to verify how authKey is validated and if proper access control checks exist in service implementation.",    "analysis": "The HotelController exposes multiple endpoints vulnerable to IDOR attacks if proper authorization isn't implemented in the service layer. The delete endpoint accepts a hotelId parameter directly in the URL, while the update endpoint allows modification of any Hotel object. The @CrossOrigin annotation permits requests from any origin. While there is an authKey parameter, without seeing the service implementation, we can't verify if proper access controls prevent unauthorized access to hotel records. The Hotel entity's direct database mapping could enable unauthorized access or modification if authorization checks are insufficient. The use of Integer IDs makes it trivial to enumerate hotel records if access control is weak.",    "poc": "1. Enumerate hotel IDs to access unauthorized records: for i in range(1,100): GET /hotel/delete/{i}/any-key 2. Modify other users' hotel data: PUT /hotel/update/any-key with body containing another user's hotel object but modified data 3. Add hotel to unauthorized package: POST /hotel/add/any-key/{target-package-id} with malicious hotel object",    "confidence_score": 6,    "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR"],    "context_code": [{        "name": "HotelServiceImpl",        "reason": "Need to verify how authKey is validated and if proper authorization checks are implemented",        "code_line": "@Autowired HotelService hotelService;"    }]}
