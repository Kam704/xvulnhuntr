Examining PackageController.java - Found CRUD operations exposed via REST endpoints with potential IDOR vulnerabilities. 2.Noticed critical functions using authKey parameter but need to see implementation. 3.Endpoints /createPackage, /updatePackage, /removePackage all take authKey but lack visible authorization logic. 4.Need to examine PackageServiceProvider implementation to understand authorization. 5.Delete operation takes pkgId parameter directly with no visible owner verification. 6.No visible checks preventing unauthorized access to packages via ID manipulation.",        "analysis": "The PackageController exposes REST endpoints for package management with potential IDOR vulnerabilities. The delete and update operations take package IDs and authKeys as parameters, but the visible code lacks proper authorization checks to verify if the requesting user has permission to access the specified package. The critical security control appears to be in the PackageServiceProvider, but we need to examine its implementation to confirm proper authorization. Without seeing the service layer, there's a risk that the authKey validation may be insufficient to prevent unauthorized access to packages via ID manipulation.",        "poc": "1. Send GET request to /packages to enumerate valid package IDs 2. Capture a valid authKey from an authenticated session 3. Use valid authKey + enumerated package IDs to access/modify packages via: DELETE /packages/removePackage?pkgId=123&authKey=KEY_HERE or PUT /packages/updatePackage with different package IDs",        "confidence_score": 6,        "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR"],        "context_code": [        {            "name": "PackageServiceProvider",            "reason": "Need to examine the service implementation to verify proper authorization checks for package operations",            "code_line": "@Autowired PackageServiceProvider pkgService;"        },        {            "name": "Packages",            "reason": "Need to examine the package model to understand what fields/data could be exposed via IDOR",            "code_line": "public ResponseEntity<Packages> addNewPackage(@Valid @RequestBody Packages pkg"        }    ]}
