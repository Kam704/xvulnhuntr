Analyzed PackageController endpoints for XSS entry points. 2.Examined Packages model class and confirmed user input fields like packageName, packageDescription, and paymentDetails. 3.Traced input flow through PackageServiceProvider which directly saves user input to database without sanitization. 4.Reviewed response EntityBuilding - Spring automatically converts responses to JSON which mitigates direct HTML context XSS. 5.However no CSP headers are set and CORS is wide open with @CrossOrigin(origins='*'). 6.Need to see how responses are rendered in UI before confirming stored XSS.",    "analysis": "The application accepts unsanitized user input in several Package fields (packageName, packageDescription, paymentDetails) through the /packages/createPackage and /packages/updatePackage endpoints. While Spring's automatic JSON serialization provides some protection, the combination of no CSP headers and wildcard CORS means any malicious scripts stored in these fields could potentially execute when rendered in a browser. However, without seeing the frontend rendering code, I cannot confirm if these fields are properly escaped when displayed.
