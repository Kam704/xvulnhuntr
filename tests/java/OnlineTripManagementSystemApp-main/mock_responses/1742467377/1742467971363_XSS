Examining PackageController for XSS vectors - Found /packages/createPackage and /packages/updatePackage accept Package object with text fields through @RequestBody. 2.Package model shows multiple user-controlled text fields (packageName, packageDescription, paymentDetails) without XSS prevention annotations. 3.Checked service layer - no sanitization happening in PackageServiceProvider. 4.Cannot confirm XSS without seeing if/how these fields are rendered in HTML/JS context - need frontend view templates. 5.@CrossOrigin(origins = '*') found, increasing XSS risk if malicious payload can be stored. 6.Need to see HTML rendering code to confirm if text fields are properly escaped when displayed.",    "analysis": "While the code reveals potentially unsafe storage of user input in text fields (packageName, packageDescription, paymentDetails) via the Package API endpoints, we cannot conclusively confirm XSS without seeing how these fields are rendered in the frontend. The @CrossOrigin(origins = '*') annotation increases risk by allowing requests from any origin. However, Spring's automatic JSON escaping provides some protection. The vulnerability rests on whether these fields are properly HTML escaped when rendered to users. Need PackageHTMLRenderer or similar view code to complete the analysis.",    "poc": "None - Cannot provide a PoC without confirming unsafe rendering in frontend code",    "confidence_score": 5,    "vulnerability_types": ["XSS"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "PackageHTMLRenderer",            "reason": "Need to see how Package fields are rendered in HTML/JavaScript context to confirm XSS vulnerability",            "code_line": "No direct reference - looking for HTML rendering component for Package display"        }    ]}
