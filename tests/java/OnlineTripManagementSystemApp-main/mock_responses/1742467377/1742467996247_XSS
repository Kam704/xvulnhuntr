The key risk factors are: 1) Multiple user-controlled string fields in the Package model including packageName, packageDescription and paymentDetails that accept arbitrary input with no content validation beyond @NotNull/@NotEmpty. 2) @CrossOrigin(origins='*') allowing requests from any domain. 3) No HTML escaping in the service layer. However, Spring's automatic JSON escaping provides some protection against XSS in REST responses. The actual vulnerability depends on how these fields are ultimately rendered in the UI - if they are inserted into HTML without proper escaping, XSS would be possible.",    "poc": "None - Cannot provide a definitive PoC without seeing the HTML rendering code that displays package details to users.",    "confidence_score": 5,    "vulnerability_types": ["XSS"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "PackageHTMLRenderer",            "reason": "Need to see how package data is rendered as HTML to determine if XSS is possible via unescaped output",            "code_line": "No direct reference - requesting based on typical Spring MVC architecture"        }    ]}
