Analyzed entry points in PackageController: GET /packages, POST /createPackage, PUT /updatePackage, DELETE /removePackage. 2.Traced input flow through controller to PackageServiceProvider methods. 3.Examined PackageServiceProvider implementation showing JPA repository usage. 4.Analyzed Package entity model - uses JPA annotations and data validation. 5.Key findings: a) Spring JPA repositories provide SQL injection protection by default through parameterized queries b) @Valid annotations enforce input validation c) Authentication via authKey provides access control d) PackageRepository extends JpaRepository implementing safe queries e) No raw SQL or string concatenation observed in provided code.",        "analysis": "After examining the complete code path from PackageController through PackageServiceProvider to the JPA repositories, no SQL injection vulnerabilities were identified. The application uses Spring Data JPA which automatically provides SQL injection protection through parameterized queries. All database operations use JPA methods (save(), findById(), findAll(), delete()) rather than raw SQL queries. Input validation is enforced via @Valid and entity constraints. The authentication system properly validates authKey before allowing data modifications. While the code handles sensitive data like packages and bookings, the implementation follows secure coding practices that prevent SQL injection attacks.",    "poc": "None - No SQL injection vulnerability found due to use of JPA parameterized queries and proper input validation",    "confidence_score": 9,    "vulnerability_types": [],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "PackageRepository",            "reason": "To verify SQL query implementation",            "code_line": "@Autowired PackageRepository pkgRepo;"        }    ]}
