The @CrossOrigin annotation allowing all origins (*) increases the attack surface. The controller accepts direct object references via ticketId which could enable IDOR attacks if proper authorization isn't implemented in the service layer. The POST endpoint accepts a Ticket object that could contain malicious data. Need to analyze the service layer implementation to determine complete vulnerability chain.",    "poc": "Potential IDOR exploitation steps: 1. Authenticate as regular user 2. Access /ticket/showTicket?ticketId=123&authKey=xyz to get own ticket 3. Iterate ticketId parameter to access other users' tickets 4.
