Analyzing TicketController.java - Found multiple endpoints that take IDs as parameters: /allTickets (packageId), /showTicket (ticketId), /createTicket (packageId,routeId), /removeTicket (ticketId). 2.All endpoints have authKey parameter which suggests some auth check, but need to verify implementation. 3.Need to check TicketService implementation to see if proper authorization is enforced. 4.Controller uses direct ID parameters without any apparent business logic validation at controller level. 5.CrossOrigin annotation allows requests from all origins (*) which increases attack surface. 6.Need to examine TicketService.getTicket(), getAllTickets(), createTicket() and deleteTicket() methods to verify authorization checks.",    "analysis": "The TicketController exposes several endpoints that use direct object references (IDs) to access resources. While authentication appears to be implemented via authKey parameter, the effectiveness depends on the TicketService implementation. The @CrossOrigin(origins = '*') annotation increases the attack surface by allowing requests from any origin. Need to examine TicketService methods to confirm proper authorization checks are implemented. Without seeing the service layer implementation, there's potential for IDOR vulnerabilities if the service doesn't properly validate that the authenticated user has permission to access the requested ticket/package/route resources.",    "poc": "Need TicketService implementation to provide a concrete PoC, but potential attack vector would be: 1. Authenticate as a regular user to get valid authKey 2. Use /ticket/showTicket?ticketId=123&authKey=[valid_key] to attempt accessing tickets belonging to other users 3. If TicketService doesn't validate ticket ownership, attacker could iterate through ticketIds to access other users' tickets",    "confidence_score": 5,    "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "TicketService",            "reason": "Need to examine implementation of ticket access methods to verify proper authorization checks",            "code_line": "@Autowired TicketService ticketService;"        }    ]}
