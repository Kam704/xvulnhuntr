Examined TicketController and TicketService files to identify potential IDOR. 2.Noticed the controller exposes endpoints (/allTickets, /showTicket, /createTicket, /removeTicket) using direct object references via ticketId parameters. 3.Authentication is implemented via authKey parameter but implementation is unknown. 4.@CrossOrigin annotation allows requests from any origin, increasing attack surface. 5.Need to see TicketServiceImpl to understand authentication/authorization implementation since interface only shows method signatures. 6.Most critical paths are getTicket() and deleteTicket() since they operate on individual ticket IDs without apparent package/route level validation. 7.The getAllTickets method accepts optional packageId parameter which could lead to unauthorized access of tickets across packages.",    "analysis": "The TicketController exposes several endpoints that could be vulnerable to IDOR attacks. The key concern is that all operations (view, create, delete) rely on direct object references (ticketId, packageId, routeId) passed as parameters, with only an authKey parameter for authentication. While the TicketService interface suggests some access control with its comments about user/admin permissions, without seeing the implementation we cannot verify if proper authorization checks prevent users from accessing or modifying tickets belonging to other users. The @CrossOrigin(origins='*') annotation makes these endpoints accessible from any domain, increasing the attack surface. The most concerning endpoints are /showTicket and /removeTicket which operate directly on ticketId without additional context validation.",    "poc": "1.
