Examined RouteController.java which exposes several REST endpoints for route management. 2.Identified key entry points: searchRoute(routeId), viewRouteList(), addRoute(route,authKey), updateRoute(route,authKey), removeRoute(routeId,authKey). 3.IDOR risk identified in searchRoute and viewRouteList - no auth checks. 4.Need to examine Route model and RouteService for potential injection points. 5.CrossOrigin(*) annotation introduces potential security risks. 6.Admin-only routes use authKey parameter but implementation unknown. 7.RequestBody Route object may contain dangerous fields - need model. 8.Need service implementation to confirm sanitization and access control.",    "analysis": "The RouteController exposes several REST endpoints with potential security issues: 1) IDOR vulnerability in searchRoute and viewRouteList endpoints due to lack of authentication/authorization checks, allowing unauthorized access to route data. 2) Weak CORS policy with @CrossOrigin(origins = '*') allowing any origin to access these endpoints. 3) Potential injection vulnerabilities through Route object fields in POST/PUT endpoints. 4) Possible auth bypass in admin endpoints due to simple authKey parameter. Need to examine RouteService implementation to confirm existence and severity of these vulnerabilities.",    "poc": "1.
