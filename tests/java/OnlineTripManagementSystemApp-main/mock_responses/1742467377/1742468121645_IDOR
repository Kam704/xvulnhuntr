Examining RouteController.java, focusing on IDOR vulnerability potential. 2.Found multiple endpoints that operate on Route objects via routeId. 3.The /searchRoute and /seeAllRoutes endpoints are publicly accessible with no authorization checks. 4.The /addRoute, /updateRoute, and /deleteRoute endpoints have an authKey parameter but need to examine implementation. 5.Need to see RouteService implementation to understand authorization checks. 6.Also need to see Route model to understand the sensitive data that could be exposed. 7.The @CrossOrigin(origins = '*') annotation allows requests from any origin which increases attack surface. 8.The searchRoute endpoint accepts routeId directly without apparent checks for ownership/authorization.",    "analysis": "The RouteController exposes several potential IDOR vulnerabilities. The most critical is the /searchRoute endpoint which accepts a routeId parameter and returns Route objects with no visible authorization checks. This could allow attackers to enumerate and access any route in the system by incrementing the routeId value. While admin operations require an authKey, the public search endpoint bypasses this. The @CrossOrigin annotation makes this especially dangerous as it allows cross-origin requests. However, to confirm exploitation and determine if there are authorization checks in the service layer, we need to examine the RouteService and Route model implementations.",    "poc": "GET /routes/searchRoute?routeId=1 \nThen iterate routeId=2,3,4... to enumerate all routes in system. This could expose sensitive route/location data if no authorization checks exist in service layer.",    "confidence_score": 7,    "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "RouteService",            "reason": "Need to examine service layer implementation to confirm if there are any authorization checks that would prevent IDOR",            "code_line": "@Autowired RouteService routeService;"        },        {            "name": "Route",            "reason": "Need to understand what sensitive data is stored in Route objects that could be exposed via IDOR",            "code_line": "public ResponseEntity<Route> searchRoute(@RequestParam Integer routeId)"        }    ]}
