Analyzing controller file RouteController.java - noticed endpoints for managing routes. 2.Examining route update/delete operations - require authKey parameter but searchRoute() and viewRouteList() do not. 3.Looking at RouteServiceImpl implementation - searchRoute() and viewRouteList() have no authorization checks. 4.Route model contains sensitive data: departure/arrival times, fare info, tied to Ticket/Travel. 5.Tickets hold package & route details. 6.Travel model exposes agent details, address, contact info. 7.RouteService interface confirms lack of auth checks for search/view. 8.Generation of routeIds uses AUTO strategy making them predictable. 9. @CrossOrigin allows requests from any domain. 10.Critical IDOR vulnerability exists in search/view operations.",    "analysis": "The code contains a confirmed IDOR vulnerability in the route search and view operations. The /routes/searchRoute and /routes/seeAllRoutes endpoints allow unauthenticated access to sensitive Route objects using only a routeId parameter or no parameters at all. Several factors make this particularly severe: 1) Route IDs are sequentially generated (GenerationType.AUTO), making them predictable 2) Cross-origin requests are allowed from any domain (@CrossOrigin(origins='*')) 3) The Route model contains sensitive data including departure/arrival times, fare information, ticket details and travel agent information 4) No authorization checks exist in either the controller or service implementation for these operations. An attacker could iterate through routeIds to access all routes and associated data. This is confirmed by examining the complete code path from controller through service to repository access.",    "poc": "1. Send GET request to /routes/searchRoute?routeId=1\n2. Observe successful response with route details\n3. Increment routeId parameter (2,3,4...) to enumerate all routes\n4. Or use /routes/seeAllRoutes to get complete route list\n5. Extract sensitive data like departure times, fares, ticket info\nCurl example:\ncurl -X GET 'http://host:8888/routes/searchRoute?routeId=1'\ncurl -X GET 'http://host:8888/routes/seeAllRoutes'",    "confidence_score": 10,    "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR"],    "context_code": []}
