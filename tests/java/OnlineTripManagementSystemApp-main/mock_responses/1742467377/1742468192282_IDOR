Examining BusController.java - Found two endpoints: /busesAll (GET) and /busesAdd/{travelId}/{authKey} (POST). 2.The /busesAll endpoint retrieves all buses without any authentication or authorization checks. 3.The /busesAdd endpoint takes travelId and authKey as path params. Need to examine BusService to understand authorization flow. 4.@CrossOrigin(origins='*') indicates this API is accessible from any domain. 5. Need to check BusService.addBus() to understand how authKey is validated and if there are IDOR vulnerabilities in accessing/modifying bus data. 6.Need to examine Bus model to understand what sensitive data might be exposed.",    "analysis": "The code shows potential IDOR vulnerabilities in both endpoints. The /busesAll endpoint appears to return all bus records without any authorization checks or filtering based on user permissions. The /busesAdd endpoint uses a travelId parameter that could be manipulated to add buses to any travel agency's account. While it has an authKey parameter, we need to examine BusService.addBus() to confirm proper authorization. The global CORS policy (@CrossOrigin(origins='*')) increases the attack surface by allowing requests from any domain.",    "poc": "1. Enumerate buses: GET /busesAll - Returns complete list of all buses in system without authorization. 2. Potential IDOR in bus addition: POST /busesAdd/1234/any_auth_key with bus payload - May allow adding buses to any travel agency by manipulating travelId if authKey validation is insufficient.",    "confidence_score": 6,    "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "BusService",            "reason": "Need to examine addBus() method to verify authorization controls and potential IDOR vulnerabilities",            "code_line": "Bus buses=bService.addBus(bus, travelId, authKey);"        },        {            "name": "Bus",            "reason": "Need to examine Bus model to understand sensitive data exposure",            "code_line": "public ResponseEntity<List<Bus>> serchTravle() throws TravelException, BusException"        }    ]}
