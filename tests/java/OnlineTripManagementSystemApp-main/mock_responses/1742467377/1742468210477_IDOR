Analyzing BusController class for IDOR vulnerabilities. 2. Two endpoints identified: /busesAll (GET) and /busesAdd (POST). 3. /busesAll has no authorization checks and returns all bus records from all agencies. 4. /busesAdd takes travelId and authKey parameters but implementation of authorization check in BusService needed. 5. Need to examine BusServiceImpl to understand authorization implementation. 6. Bus model shows sensitive fields including busId and relationship to Travel entity. 7. Risk of unauthorized access to all bus records and potential manipulation of bus-travel agency relationships.",    "analysis": "The BusController contains two significant IDOR vulnerabilities: 1) The /busesAll endpoint exposes all bus records across all travel agencies without any authorization checks or filtering, allowing unauthorized access to potentially sensitive business data. 2) The /busesAdd endpoint accepts a travelId parameter that could be manipulated to add buses to any travel agency's account. While it includes an authKey parameter, we need to verify the implementation in BusServiceImpl. The Bus entity contains sensitive fields and a relationship to Travel entity that could be exposed or manipulated through these endpoints. The global CORS policy (@CrossOrigin(origins='*')) compounds the vulnerability by allowing cross-origin requests from any domain.",    "poc": "1. Enumerate all bus records: GET /busesAll - This will return sensitive data for all bus agencies without authorization. 2. For /busesAdd endpoint: POST /busesAdd/123/any-auth-key with body: {\"busType\":\"AC\",\"busNo\":1234,\"capacity\":50} - Try different travelId values to potentially add buses to any agency's account.",    "confidence_score": 7,    "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "BusServiceImpl",            "reason": "Need to examine the implementation of addBus() to verify authorization checks and confirm IDOR vulnerability in /busesAdd endpoint",            "code_line": "@Autowired private BusService bService;"        }    ]}
