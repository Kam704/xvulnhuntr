Examining BusController: Two endpoints - /busesAll (GET) and /busesAdd (POST). 2.Authorization checks - /busesAll has no auth checks, /busesAdd uses authKey but implementation not visible. 3.Entity analysis - Bus model has sensitive fields (busId, busNo) and relationship to Travel entity. 4.CORS policy set to allow all origins (*). 5.Critical request for BusServiceImpl to verify authKey implementation and authorization. 6.Travel entity relationship needs examination for potential data exposure. 7.Need to examine BusServiceImpl to verify if travelId parameter is properly authorized.",    "analysis": "The BusController contains confirmed IDOR vulnerabilities: 1) The /busesAll endpoint exposes all bus records without authorization, allowing any user to access sensitive business data across all travel agencies. 2) The /busesAdd endpoint accepts a travelId parameter that could be manipulated to add buses to unauthorized travel agencies, though full confirmation requires BusServiceImpl code.
