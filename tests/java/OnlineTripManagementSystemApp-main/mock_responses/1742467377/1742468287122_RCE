Analyzing the BusController.java file for potential RCE vulnerabilities. 2.Found two endpoints /busesAll (GET) and /busesAdd/{travelId}/{authKey} (POST) 3.The POST endpoint takes Bus object as JSON body which could be an attack vector 4.Need to analyze Bus model for any unsafe deserialization 5.Checking BusService implementation for potential command execution 6.@CrossOrigin(origins = '*') indicates the API is accessible from any origin 7.Need to see validation of authKey parameter 8.RequestBody deserialization could be dangerous if Bus class has unsafe objects",        "analysis": "The BusController exposes endpoints that accept remote user input via JSON deserialization and path parameters. The key areas of concern are: 1) The @RequestBody Bus object deserialization in /busesAdd endpoint which could potentially lead to unsafe deserialization if the Bus class contains dangerous types 2) The authKey parameter validation in BusService needs to be analyzed 3) The unrestricted CORS policy with @CrossOrigin(origins='*') makes the API accessible from any domain. To properly assess RCE risk, we need to analyze the Bus model class and BusService implementation.",    "poc": "None - Need to analyze Bus model and BusService implementation first",    "confidence_score": 3,    "vulnerability_types": ["RCE"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "Bus",            "reason": "Need to analyze Bus model class for unsafe deserialization vectors",            "code_line": "@RequestBody Bus bus"        },        {            "name": "BusService",            "reason": "Need to analyze addBus method implementation for command execution and authKey validation",            "code_line": "Bus buses=bService.addBus(bus, travelId, authKey);"        }    ]}
