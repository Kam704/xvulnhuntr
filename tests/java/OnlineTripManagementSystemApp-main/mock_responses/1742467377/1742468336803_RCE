Examining BusController.java for RCE vectors: - Found two endpoints /busesAll and /busesAdd - /busesAdd accepts Bus object via @RequestBody, authKey and travelId as path variables - @CrossOrigin(*) suggests unrestricted access 2.Analyzing Bus.java model: - Contains only primitive types (Integer, BusType enum) and JPA relationships - No custom deserialization logic 3.Examining Travel.java: - Contains Address embedding and Bus relationships - Uses standard JPA annotations and relationships 4.Need to examine BusServiceImpl to see: - How authKey validation is performed - Any unsafe deserialization or object processing - Dynamic class loading or reflection usage - Request additional context for BusServiceImpl",    "analysis": "After reviewing the available code, there are no clear RCE vulnerabilities present. While the Bus controller accepts remote user input via @RequestBody deserialization, the Bus model only contains primitive types and standard JPA relationships that use framework-handled deserialization. The @CrossOrigin(*) annotation makes the endpoints accessible from any origin but does not introduce RCE vectors by itself. However, to make a complete assessment, we need to analyze the BusServiceImpl class implementation to verify how the authKey validation works and confirm there is no unsafe deserialization or command execution in the service layer.",    "poc": "None",    "confidence_score": 5,    "vulnerability_types": [],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "BusServiceImpl",            "reason": "Need to examine the implementation of Bus creation and validation to verify no unsafe deserialization or command execution",            "code_line": "@Autowired private BusService bService;"        }    ]}
