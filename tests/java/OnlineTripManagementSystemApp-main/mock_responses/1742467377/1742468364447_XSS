Analyzed BusController class for XSS vulnerabilities. Two main endpoints: GET /busesAll and POST /busesAdd/{travelId}/{authKey}. 2.The /busesAll endpoint returns a list of Bus objects, need to see Bus model class to check for unsafe data. 3.The /busesAdd endpoint accepts a Bus object in request body and returns it, need Bus class to check fields. 4.@CrossOrigin(origins='*') indicates relaxed CORS policy. 5.Need Bus model class to see what fields could contain user input that gets reflected. 6.Need BusService implementation to trace data flow. 7.Core concern is reflection of user-provided Bus object data in response JSON without proper encoding.",    "analysis": "Initial analysis of BusController reveals potential XSS vulnerabilities due to reflection of user input in JSON responses. The main risk comes from the /busesAdd endpoint which accepts and reflects back a Bus object. The @CrossOrigin annotation with '*' allows requests from any origin, increasing the attack surface. However, to confirm exploitability, we need to see the Bus model class to identify fields that could contain malicious content, and the BusService implementation to understand any sanitization. Spring's default JSON serialization provides some protection, but certain fields in the Bus model could still be vulnerable if they contain unescaped HTML/JavaScript.",    "poc": "Proof of concept pending analysis of Bus model class - specific payload would target injectable fields in Bus object.",    "confidence_score": 5,    "vulnerability_types": ["XSS"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "Bus",            "reason": "Need to examine Bus model class fields for potential XSS injection points",            "code_line": "@RequestBody Bus bus"        },        {            "name": "BusService",            "reason": "Need to check implementation for any sanitization of user input",            "code_line": "@Autowired private BusService bService;"        }    ]}
