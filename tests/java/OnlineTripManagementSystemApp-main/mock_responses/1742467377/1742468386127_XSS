Analyzed BusController.java that exposes 2 endpoints: /busesAll (GET) and /busesAdd (POST). 2.Examined Bus.java model which shows fields: busId, busType (enum), busNo, capacity, and tDetails (Travel object). 3.The /busesAdd endpoint takes Bus object as request body & reflects it in response. 4.Key finding: Bus object is directly serialized to JSON and returned in ResponseEntity. 5.@CrossOrigin('*') allows requests from any origin. 6.Need to see BusServiceImpl to understand validation/sanitization. 7.Current code chain: Remote request -> @RequestBody Bus -> ResponseEntity<Bus> -> JSON response. 8.Spring's default Jackson serialization provides some XSS protection but need to verify handling of special characters.",    "analysis": "After examining the code, the potential for XSS exists but is partially mitigated by Spring's default JSON serialization. The /busesAdd endpoint reflects user input from the Bus object directly in the JSON response. While Spring's Jackson serializer does escape HTML special characters by default, certain JSON contexts could still be vulnerable if the response is processed unsafely by client-side code. The main risk comes from the Bus object's fields (busNo, capacity) being reflected without explicit validation. The @CrossOrigin('*') annotation increases exposure by allowing requests from any origin. However, without seeing the BusServiceImpl class to confirm lack of input validation and the client-side code handling the JSON response, we cannot confirm full exploitability.",    "poc": "POST /busesAdd/1/key123\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"busNo\": 1,\n  \"capacity\": \"</script><script>alert(1)</script>\",\n  \"busType\": \"AC\"\n}\n\nNote: Actual exploitability depends on client-side handling of the JSON response.",    "confidence_score": 6,    "vulnerability_types": ["XSS"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "BusServiceImpl",            "reason": "Need to verify if any input validation or sanitization is performed before storing/reflecting the Bus object",            "code_line": "@Autowired private BusService bService;"        }    ]}
