First analyzing BusController.java with focus on XSS. Found two endpoints: GET /busesAll and POST /busesAdd. Both reflect Bus object data in JSON responses. 2. Examining Bus.java model shows fields exposed: busId, busType, busNo, capacity. JSON serialization happens via Spring's default Jackson serializer. 3. Checking for input validation - need to see BusServiceImpl to confirm if any validation exists. 4. @CrossOrigin('*') allows requests from any origin, increasing attack surface. 5. Spring's Jackson serializer does escape HTML special characters by default when serializing to JSON. 6. Need BusServiceImpl to confirm lack of input validation and complete analysis of potential XSS through JSON injection. 7. Without client-side code showing how JSON responses are processed, full exploitability cannot be confirmed.",    "analysis": "Based on review of the BusController and related code, there is potential for XSS through unsafe client-side processing of JSON responses, but several factors reduce the risk and confidence level. The endpoints (/busesAll and /busesAdd) reflect Bus object data in JSON responses with fields like busNo and capacity that accept user input. While Spring's Jackson serializer provides default HTML escaping for JSON, XSS could still occur if client-side code unsafely processes these JSON responses (e.g. using eval() or innerHTML). The @CrossOrigin('*') annotation increases exposure by allowing cross-origin requests. However, without seeing the BusServiceImpl for input validation and client-side code handling the responses, the complete exploitability cannot be confirmed.",    "poc": "1. Submit Bus with malicious payload:\nPOST /busesAdd/1/authkey\n{\"busNo\": \"</script><script>alert(1)</script>\", \"capacity\": 50}\n\n2. If client uses unsafe JSON parsing like:\nlet bus = eval('(' + response + ')');\ndocument.getElementById('busNo').innerHTML = bus.busNo;\n\nThe XSS would execute. But this depends on client implementation.",    "confidence_score": 5,    "vulnerability_types": ["XSS"],    "context_code": [{        "name": "BusServiceImpl",        "reason": "Need to check for any input validation on Bus fields before storage/reflection",        "code_line": "@Autowired private BusService bService;"    }]  }
