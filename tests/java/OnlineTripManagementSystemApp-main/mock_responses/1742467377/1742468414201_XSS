Analyzed BusController and Bus model code for XSS vulnerabilities. 2.BusController exposes 2 endpoints: /busesAll (GET) and /busesAdd (POST). 3.Both endpoints return Bus objects serialized as JSON. 4.Bus model fields could contain malicious content: busNo (Integer), busType (Enum), capacity (Integer). 5.Need BusServiceImpl to analyze input validation. 6.Spring's default Jackson serializer provides JSON escaping. 7.@CrossOrigin('*') allows cross-origin access, increasing exposure. 8.Integer fields limit direct XSS impact. 9.Need BusServiceImpl implementation to verify any input validation/sanitization.",    "analysis": "Based on the available code, there is a relatively low risk of XSS vulnerabilities. The BusController exposes REST endpoints that return JSON data, with Spring's Jackson serializer providing default JSON escaping. The Bus model fields are mostly restricted to Integer types, which limits direct XSS payload injection. While @CrossOrigin('*') increases exposure by allowing cross-origin requests, exploitation would require unsafe client-side processing of the JSON responses (e.g. using eval() or innerHTML). Without seeing the BusServiceImpl code for potential input validation bypasses and client-side code handling the responses, we cannot confirm full exploitability.",    "poc": "None - While theoretically possible through client-side JSON processing vulnerabilities, cannot confirm exploitability without BusServiceImpl validation logic and client-side code.",    "confidence_score": 3,    "vulnerability_types": ["XSS"],    "context_code": [{        "name": "BusServiceImpl",        "reason": "Need to analyze input validation and sanitization logic",        "code_line": "@Autowired private BusService bService;"    }]}
