The @CrossOrigin('*') annotation increases attack surface by allowing requests from any origin. The current code uses Spring's Jackson serializer which provides default JSON escaping, but without seeing the complete implementation including client-side code and the Travel object referenced in the Bus model, we cannot rule out XSS vectors completely.",    "poc": "None - Cannot construct reliable PoC without full code path analysis",    "confidence_score": 3,    "vulnerability_types": ["XSS"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "BusServiceImpl",            "reason": "Need to analyze input validation and processing logic",            "code_line": "@Autowired private BusService bService;"        },        {            "name": "Travel",            "reason": "Referenced in Bus model, need to check for injectable string fields",            "code_line": "@ManyToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL) private Travel tDetails;"        }    ]}
