Reviewed BusController.java and identified potential entry points: /busesAll GET endpoint and /busesAdd/{travelId}/{authKey} POST endpoint. 2.Need to trace how Bus objects are handled through BusService to check for SQL injection. 3.The code shows use of @Autowired BusService but implementation details are not visible. 4.POST endpoint accepts Bus object via @RequestBody which could contain malicious payloads. 5.Need to see BusService implementation to determine if user input is properly sanitized before any database operations. 6.Need to check Bus model class for any custom deserialization that could lead to SQL injection. 7.CrossOrigin annotation with wildcard * increases attack surface by allowing requests from any origin.",        "analysis": "The BusController exposes two endpoints that process user input: a GET endpoint retrieving all buses and a POST endpoint for adding new buses. While Spring's @RequestBody typically provides some protection against basic injection attacks, we need to analyze how the Bus object properties are ultimately used in database queries through the BusService layer. The controller uses CrossOrigin with wildcard *, which increases the attack surface by allowing requests from any domain. To properly assess SQL injection risks, we need to examine both the Bus model class for any custom deserializers and the BusService implementation to see how the user input is processed before database operations.",        "poc": "None - Cannot construct reliable PoC without seeing BusService implementation and Bus model",        "confidence_score": 3,        "vulnerability_types": ["SQLI"],        "context_code": [        {            "name": "BusService",            "reason": "Need to analyze how user input from controller is processed before database operations",            "code_line": "@Autowired private BusService bService;"        },        {            "name": "Bus",            "reason": "Need to examine model class for potential deserialization vulnerabilities",            "code_line": "@RequestBody Bus bus"        }    ]}
