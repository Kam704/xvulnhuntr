Identified two API endpoints: GET /busesAll and POST /busesAdd/{travelId}/{authKey}. 2.POST endpoint accepts Bus object via @RequestBody and path variables travelId and authKey. 3.GET endpoint retrieves all buses without authentication. 4.Bus entity uses JPA annotations, indicating Hibernate ORM usage. 5.@CrossOrigin(origins='*') allows requests from any origin. 6.Cannot fully trace data flow without BusServiceImpl implementation which handles database operations. 7.Potential for unsafe SQL if service layer uses raw queries. 8.Need to verify authentication and authorization controls. Requesting BusServiceImpl to analyze actual database operations.",    "analysis": "The code exposes vulnerabilities through unrestricted CORS and potentially unsafe database operations. While JPA typically prevents SQL injection through parameterization, we need to verify the actual implementation in BusServiceImpl. The POST endpoint's validation of authKey and travelId parameters needs review. The lack of authentication on the GET endpoint could expose sensitive data. The @CrossOrigin(origins='*') annotation creates a permissive CORS policy that could enable malicious cross-origin requests.",    "poc": "Potential attack vectors (pending BusServiceImpl review): 1. Cross-origin attack: GET /busesAll from any domain 2.
