Examining BusController.java: Found 2 endpoints: GET /busesAll and POST /busesAdd/{travelId}/{authKey}. CORS is wide open with @CrossOrigin(origins='*'). 2.Analyzing Bus.java: Uses JPA @Entity annotations, suggesting ORM usage which typically prevents SQLI. 3.BusService interface shows method signatures but need implementation to verify security. 4.Key gaps: Need BusServiceImpl to analyze actual database operations and authKey validation. Need Travel model to understand relationship. 5.Entry points analysis: POST accepts Bus object from request body and path variables travelId/authKey. GET has no parameters. 6.Control flow: Bus object goes through BusService.addBus() but implementation unknown. Need to verify sanitization and validation.",        "analysis": "The code shows concerning security issues, primarily due to unrestricted CORS and potential IDOR/authentication bypass risks. The @CrossOrigin(origins='*') allows any origin to access these endpoints. While JPA/Hibernate typically prevents SQLI through parameterized queries, we need BusServiceImpl to confirm safe implementation. The /busesAll endpoint lacks authentication, potentially exposing sensitive data. The authKey parameter in /busesAdd lacks visible validation. The main risks are IDOR and authentication bypass rather than SQLI due to JPA usage.",        "poc": "1. CORS bypass: Send request from malicious origin:\nPOST /busesAdd/1/fakekey\nOrigin: evil.com\nContent-Type: application/json\n{\"busType\":\"DELUXE\",\"busNo\":1337,\"capacity\":50}\n\n2.
