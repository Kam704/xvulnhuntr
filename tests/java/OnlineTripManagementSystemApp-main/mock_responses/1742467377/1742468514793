Examining ReportController: REST API with /admin endpoints. Key inputs: reportId (Integer), authKey (String), Report object in request body. 2.Authentication check appears to use authKey param but implementation unknown. 3.@CrossOrigin(origins='*') allows requests from any domain - potential security concern. 4.CRUD operations on Report object but sanitization/validation unclear. 5.Need to analyze Report model, ReportService, and UserAuthenticationServices for complete security review.",    "analysis": "Initial analysis reveals several potential security concerns: 1. @CrossOrigin with wildcard allows requests from any origin, potentially enabling CSRF/XSS attacks. 2. The authKey parameter appears to be the only authentication mechanism but its validation is unknown without seeing the service implementation. 3. Report object is accepted directly from request body - potential for injection attacks depending on model fields. 4. IDOR risk exists in getAllReports and deleteReport endpoints where reportId parameter could allow unauthorized access to reports. 5. Proper input validation and access control cannot be confirmed without service layer code.",    "poc": "None - Need implementation details of service layer and models to develop concrete exploit.",    "confidence_score": 4,    "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR", "XSS"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "Report",            "reason": "Need to examine Report model fields and validation annotations",            "code_line": "@Valid @RequestBody Report report"        },        {            "name": "ReportService",            "reason": "Contains business logic and validation for report operations",            "code_line": "@Autowired ReportService repoService"        },        {            "name": "UserAuthenticationServices",            "reason": "Handles authentication logic for authKey validation",            "code_line": "@Autowired UserAuthenticationServices services"        }    ]}
