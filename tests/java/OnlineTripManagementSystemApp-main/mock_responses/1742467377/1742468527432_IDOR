Initial review of ReportController shows admin endpoints for report management. Critical services used: UserAuthenticationServices and ReportService. Need to verify authorization and access control. 2.Noticed @RequestParam(required = false) for reportId and authKey in getAllReports - potentially dangerous. 3.Report model operations (view/add/delete) require authKey but need to verify implementation. 4.No direct path authorization checks visible in controller. 5.Need to examine ReportService implementation to understand access control and authorization logic. 6.CrossOrigin allows all origins (*) which increases attack surface. 7.Need to verify if authKey alone is sufficient for access control.",    "analysis": "The ReportController exposes potential IDOR vulnerabilities due to several concerning patterns: 1) The getAllReports endpoint makes both reportId and authKey optional parameters (@RequestParam(required = false)), potentially allowing unauthorized access. 2) The authKey parameter appears to be the only access control mechanism, but its implementation needs verification. 3) No explicit user role or permission checks are visible at the controller level. 4) CrossOrigin is set to allow all origins (*). To confirm the IDOR vulnerability, we need to examine the ReportService implementation to understand how the authKey is validated and if proper authorization checks exist.",    "poc": "Without seeing the implementation of ReportService and UserAuthenticationServices, a theoretical PoC would be: 1) Capture a valid authKey from an authenticated session 2) Use that authKey to access reports via /admin/reports?authKey=captured_key 3) Attempt to access the endpoint without an authKey 4) Try accessing with a different user's authKey 5) For deleteReport, systematically iterate through reportId values to access/delete other users' reports: /admin/removeReport?reportId=1&authKey=captured_key",    "confidence_score": 6,    "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "ReportService",            "reason": "Need to examine the implementation of report operations and authorization checks",            "code_line": "@Autowired ReportService repoService;"        },        {            "name": "UserAuthenticationServices",            "reason": "Need to verify authentication and authorization implementation",            "code_line": "@Autowired UserAuthenticationServices services;"        }    ]}
