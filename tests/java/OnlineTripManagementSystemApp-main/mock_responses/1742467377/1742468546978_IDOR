Examining ReportController first - noticed @CrossOrigin(origins = '*') allowing requests from any origin. 2.Found 3 endpoints: getAllReports, createReport, deleteReport - all protected only by authKey parameter. 3.getAllReports makes authKey optional with @RequestParam(required = false). 4.Analyzed ReportService interface - reveals admin-only functions but implementation details missing. 5.No explicit role checks visible at controller level. 6.User auth services available but actual implementation unclear. 7.Need to see concrete ReportService implementation to understand if proper authorization exists. 8.IDOR risk present since reportId can be manipulated and authorization appears weak.",    "analysis": "The code reveals multiple potential IDOR vulnerabilities. The ReportController exposes three endpoints that only use an authKey parameter for access control, with getAllReports making this parameter optional. The @CrossOrigin annotation allows requests from any origin, increasing the attack surface. Most concerning is that the endpoints accept report IDs directly from user input with no visible validation of whether the requesting user should have access to that report. While the ReportService interface indicates these should be admin-only functions, the actual implementation of the authorization checks is not visible. Without seeing proper role validation or ownership verification, an attacker could potentially access or modify any report by manipulating the reportId parameter.",    "poc": "1. IDOR in getAllReports: Send GET request to /admin/reports without authKey or with forged authKey. 2. IDOR in deleteReport: Send DELETE request to /admin/removeReport?reportId=123&authKey=<forged_key> where reportId is any desired report ID. An attacker can iterate through report IDs to delete arbitrary reports if authorization is not properly implemented.",    "confidence_score": 7,    "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "ReportServiceImpl",            "reason": "Need to see actual implementation of authorization checks and report access control",            "code_line": "@Autowired ReportService repoService;"        }    ]}
