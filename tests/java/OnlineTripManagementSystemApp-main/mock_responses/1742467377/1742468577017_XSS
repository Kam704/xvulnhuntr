Examining ReportController.java for XSS vulnerabilities. 2.Controller uses @RestController annotation indicating JSON responses by default. 3.Three endpoints identified: GET /admin/reports, POST /admin/addReport, DELETE /admin/removeReport. 4.Report object is returned directly in responses. 5.Need to examine Report model class and ReportService implementation to trace user input handling. 6.CrossOrigin annotation with '*' allows requests from any domain. 7.Need to see input validation in ReportService.addReport() and Report model class.",    "analysis": "The code exposes potential XSS vulnerabilities through direct reflection of user input via the Report object model in REST responses. While Spring's @RestController typically returns JSON responses which would normally mitigate XSS, the broad CORS policy (@CrossOrigin(origins='*')) combined with potential HTML content in the Report model fields could enable XSS attacks if the front-end directly injects this content into the DOM. However, to confirm this vulnerability and understand the full attack surface, we need to examine the Report model class and ReportService implementation to trace how user input is handled, validated and processed before being returned in the response.",    "poc": "None - Need Report model and ReportService implementation to develop accurate PoC",    "confidence_score": 5,    "vulnerability_types": ["XSS"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "Report",            "reason": "Need to examine Report model fields and any input validation annotations",            "code_line": "@Valid @RequestBody Report report"        },        {            "name": "ReportService",            "reason": "Need to examine how user input is processed before being returned",            "code_line": "createdReport = repoService.addReport(report, authKey)"        }    ]}
