Examined ReportController.java which exposes REST API endpoints under /admin for report management. 2.Report model shows reportName and reportType fields that accept unconstrained string data. 3.Controller uses @CrossOrigin(origins='*') allowing requests from any domain. 4.Report object data is directly serialized to JSON in responses via @RestController. 5.Need to examine ReportService implementation to understand validation. 6.Direct reflection of user input exists in Report fields returned in JSON responses. 7.While responses are JSON, front-end processing could enable XSS if content is unsafely rendered.",    "analysis": "Based on the code review, there is a potential for stored XSS through the Report object fields. The ReportController accepts unconstrained string input in reportName and reportType fields via the POST /admin/addReport endpoint, which gets stored and later retrieved via GET /admin/reports. The permissive CORS policy (@CrossOrigin(origins='*')) allows these endpoints to be accessed from any domain. While Spring's @RestController typically protects against XSS by returning JSON, the vulnerability becomes exploitable if the front-end application unsafely renders the retrieved report data into HTML. However, to confirm the full attack chain and provide a higher confidence assessment, we need to examine the ReportService implementation to understand any server-side validation or sanitization that may be in place.",     "poc": "1.
