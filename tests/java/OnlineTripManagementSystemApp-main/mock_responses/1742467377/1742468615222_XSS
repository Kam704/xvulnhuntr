Examined ReportController which exposes /admin/reports GET endpoint and /admin/addReport POST endpoint. 2.Traced user input in Report model - allows arbitrary strings in reportName and reportType fields. 3.Analyzed ReportServiceImpl implementation - no input sanitization or validation beyond admin role check. 4.Reviewed full code path: User input -> ReportController.createReport() -> ReportServiceImpl.addReport() -> reportRepo.save() -> Database -> ReportController.getAllReports() -> JSON Response. 5.Confirmed no XSS protection/sanitization in entire chain. 6.While Spring @RestController typically protects against XSS via JSON encoding, unsafe front-end rendering could enable stored XSS. 7.CORS policy (@CrossOrigin('*')) enables cross-origin access. 8.Primary risk is stored XSS if front-end unsafely renders report fields.",    "analysis": "The application contains a stored XSS vulnerability through the Report management endpoints. The /admin/addReport POST endpoint accepts arbitrary string input in reportName and reportType fields with no sanitization or validation beyond an admin role check. This data is stored in the database and later retrieved via /admin/reports GET endpoint. While Spring's @RestController provides some protection by returning JSON, the vulnerability becomes exploitable if the front-end application unsafely renders the retrieved report data (e.g. using innerHTML or dangerouslySetInnerHTML). The permissive CORS policy (@CrossOrigin(origins='*')) allows these endpoints to be accessed from any origin, increasing the attack surface. The full code path from user input to storage and retrieval is visible, showing no XSS protection mechanisms.",    "poc": "1. Store XSS payload: POST /admin/addReport with body: {\"reportName\": \"<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>\", \"reportType\": \"test\"} 2. Retrieve via GET /admin/reports 3.
