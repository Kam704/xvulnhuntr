  Analyzing the BookingController class which exposes 4 REST endpoints for managing bookings: /booking/cancel (DELETE), /booking/book (POST), /booking/showBooking (GET), /booking/showAllBooking (GET). All endpoints are marked with @CrossOrigin(origins = '*') which allows any origin to access them. 2. Identified potential IDOR issues in multiple endpoints: showBooking allows viewing bookings by userId without authentication checks visible, cancel allows canceling any booking by ID, showAllBooking uses only an authKey param for admin access. 3. Need to analyze BookingService implementation to understand authentication/authorization controls and data access patterns. 4. POST /booking/book endpoint accepts a Booking object which could contain unsanitized data - need to see Booking model and service layer validation. 5. All endpoints interface with booking data storage - need to see service implementation to check for SQL injection risks.",        "analysis": "The BookingController exposes several REST endpoints with concerning security issues: 1. IDOR risks in multiple endpoints due to direct object access via IDs without visible access control. 2. Overly permissive CORS policy allows any origin. 3. Potential authentication bypass in showAllBooking using only authKey parameter. 4. Possible injection risks in booking creation endpoint depending on input validation. The main security concern is IDOR as the endpoints allow direct access to booking records via ID parameters without showing proper authorization checks. Additional code context is needed to fully assess other vulnerability types.",        "poc": "IDOR exploit on /booking/showBooking: 1. Login as a normal user 2. Send GET request to /booking/showBooking?userId=<other_user_id> 3. If authorization is not properly implemented in service layer, this will expose other users' booking details",        "confidence_score": 6,        "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR"],        "context_code": [        {            "name": "BookingService",            "reason": "Need to analyze service layer implementation for authentication, authorization and data access controls",            "code_line": "@Autowired BookingService bookingService;"        },        {            "name": "Booking",            "reason": "Need to examine Booking model for input validation and data handling",            "code_line": "public ResponseEntity<Booking> makeBookings(@Valid @RequestBody Booking booking, @RequestParam Integer pkgId)"        }    ]}
