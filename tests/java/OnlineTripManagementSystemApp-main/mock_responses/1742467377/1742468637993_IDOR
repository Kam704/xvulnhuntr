However, to confirm these vulnerabilities and determine their exploitability, we need to examine the BookingService implementation to verify if proper authorization checks exist at the service layer.",    "poc": "GET /booking/showBooking?userId=123 - Potentially allows accessing bookings for any user by changing userId.
