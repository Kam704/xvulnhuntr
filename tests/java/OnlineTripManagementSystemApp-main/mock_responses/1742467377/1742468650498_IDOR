Examining BookingController: Multiple endpoints look vulnerable to IDOR. 2.Need to check BookingServiceImpl for authorization checks. 3.cancelBooking endpoint takes bookingId with no visible authorization, potential vulnerability. 4.viewBookings endpoint takes userId parameter with no visible authorization. 5.viewAllBookings takes only authKey with no userId validation. 6.makeBooking endpoint takes pkgId with no ownership verification. 7.@CrossOrigin(origins = '*') allows requests from any domain, increasing attack surface. 8.Need BookingServiceImpl to verify if proper auth checks exist at service layer.",    "analysis": "Based on the code review of BookingController and BookingService interface, there are strong indicators of multiple IDOR vulnerabilities. The controller exposes several endpoints that accept user-controllable IDs without visible authorization checks. The @CrossOrigin annotation allowing all origins (*) increases the attack surface. Key vulnerabilities: 1) /booking/showBooking endpoint accepts userId parameter with no visible auth check, 2) /booking/cancel accepts bookingId without ownership verification, 3) /booking/book accepts pkgId without access validation. To confirm exploitability and determine if proper authorization exists at service layer, need to examine BookingServiceImpl.",    "poc": "1.
