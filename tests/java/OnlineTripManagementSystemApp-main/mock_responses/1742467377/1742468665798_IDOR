Initial Analysis: Reviewing /booking/showBooking endpoint: takes userId parameter with no authentication check. Checking BookingService: viewBookings method does not verify caller has permission to view requested userId's bookings. 2.Analysis of /booking/cancel: Takes bookingId parameter. BookingServiceImpl.cancelBooking has no ownership verification, any authenticated user could cancel any booking. 3.Analysis of /booking/showAllBooking: Admin authorization check exists but uses authKey parameter directly from request without validation. 4.Attack Surface Analysis: @CrossOrigin(origins='*') allows requests from any domain. No CSRF protection visible. 5.Deep Dive - bookingService.viewBookings(): Only checks if user exists, no authorization. 6.Deep Dive - bookingService.cancelBooking(): Only checks if booking exists, no ownership validation. 7.Deep Dive - bookingService.viewAllBookings(): authKey validation exists but susceptible to session key theft.",    "analysis": "Multiple critical IDOR vulnerabilities confirmed in the booking management endpoints: 1) The /booking/showBooking endpoint allows any user to view any other user's bookings by simply changing the userId parameter. No authentication or authorization checks exist in either the controller or service layer. 2) The /booking/cancel endpoint allows any user to cancel any booking by providing the bookingId, with no verification that the caller owns the booking. 3) The /booking/showAllBooking endpoint's admin check can potentially be bypassed through session token theft due to poor validation. All vulnerabilities are made more severe by the @CrossOrigin(origins='*') annotation allowing cross-origin requests from any domain.",    "poc": "1. View Any User's Bookings:\nGET /booking/showBooking?userId=123\n\n2. Cancel Any Booking:\nDELETE /booking/cancel?bookingId=456\n\n3. View All Bookings (Admin bypass):\nGET /booking/showAllBooking?authKey=[stolen_admin_token]\n\nThese requests can be made from any origin due to CORS settings. No CSRF token or other request validation required.",    "confidence_score": 9,    "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR"],    "context_code": []}
