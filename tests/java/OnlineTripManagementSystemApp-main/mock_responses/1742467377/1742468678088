Code analysis shows Bus.java is an entity model with JPA annotations. 2.The model contains a busId, busType, busNo, capacity and tDetails fields. 3.The primary key busId uses auto-generation strategy which could be a source of IDOR. 4.JPA cascade=ALL on the ManyToOne relationship could allow unauthorized data manipulation. 5.Need to see controller/service layer to confirm user input paths. 6.Model does not have direct input validation/sanitization. 7.Auto-generated IDs could enable enumeration attacks.",    "analysis": "The Bus entity model exposes several potential IDOR vulnerabilities due to: 1) Auto-generated sequential IDs that could be enumerated, 2) JPA cascade=ALL annotation that propagates operations to related entities, potentially allowing unauthorized data modifications through related objects. The model itself doesn't implement any access controls or input validation. However, to confirm exploitability, we need to analyze the controller layer handling bus operations and any service layer authorization checks.",    "poc": "Need controller code to create full PoC, but potential IDOR attack vector would involve: 1) Authenticate as regular user 2) Note sequential nature of busId 3) Modify requests to access/modify other bus records by incrementing/decrementing busId values 4) Leverage cascade=ALL to modify related Travel entity data",    "confidence_score": 3,    "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "BusController",            "reason": "Need to see how bus entity is exposed via API endpoints and what authorization controls exist",            "code_line": "@Entity @Table(name=\"Bus\")"        },        {            "name": "BusService",             "reason": "Need to analyze service layer authorization and data access controls",            "code_line": "@Entity @Table(name=\"Bus\")"        }    ]}
