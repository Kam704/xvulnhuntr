The code shows a Bus class using JPA annotations for DB mapping. 2.The class contains fields for busId,busType,busNo,capacity,tDetails. 3.The busId uses @Id annotation and auto-generation. 4.The file contains model code but lacks controller/service layer code showing how these objects are accessed. 5.To analyze for IDOR, need to see REST API endpoints and authorization logic. 6.Since Travel entity is referenced, may need that code too. 7.Some observations pointing to potential IDOR risks: a)busId is auto-generated but exposed b)Many-to-One relationship with Travel entity means bus IDs could be enumerated c)Lack of obvious authorization checks in model layer.",    "analysis": "Based on the provided Bus model class, while there are potential IDOR risks due to exposed auto-generated IDs and entity relationships, I cannot make a confident assessment of IDOR vulnerabilities without seeing the controller/service layer code that handles bus-related operations. Key missing pieces: 1) REST endpoints that expose bus data 2) Authorization checks when accessing bus records 3) Input validation and access control logic 4) Travel entity relationship details. The model suggests buses can be accessed by ID and are linked to Travel records, but how this access is controlled needs to be examined.",    "poc": "None - insufficient code context to develop a concrete exploit",    "confidence_score": 2,    "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "BusController",            "reason": "Need to see REST endpoints and authorization logic for accessing Bus resources",            "code_line": "None - Class inferred from application architecture"        },        {            "name": "Travel",             "reason": "Referenced in ManyToOne relationship, need to understand entity relationship",            "code_line": "@ManyToOne(cascade=CascadeType.ALL) private Travel tDetails;"        }    ]}
