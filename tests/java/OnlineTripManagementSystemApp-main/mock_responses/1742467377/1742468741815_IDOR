Reviewing provided code: We have Bus model class, Travel model class, BusController and BusService interface. Need BusServiceImpl to understand auth checks. 2.BusController exposes 2 endpoints: /busesAll and /busesAdd/{travelId}/{authKey}. 3.The /busesAll endpoint retrieves all buses across all agencies without auth checks. 4.The /busesAdd endpoint takes travelId parameter which could be vulnerable to IDOR. 5.Need to examine BusServiceImpl to understand authorization implementation for travelId/authKey. 6.Current code shows no validation that user owns/has rights to access specified travelId.",    "analysis": "After reviewing the codebase, there are two clear IDOR vulnerabilities: 1) The /busesAll endpoint allows unauthorized access to all bus records across all travel agencies without any authentication or authorization checks. This endpoint exposes sensitive business data. 2) The /busesAdd/{travelId}/{authKey} endpoint accepts a travelId parameter that can be manipulated to add buses to any travel agency's account. While it includes an authKey parameter, without seeing the BusServiceImpl we cannot confirm proper authorization checks. The integer-based ID system makes it trivial to enumerate and access/modify other agencies' data.",    "poc": "IDOR #1 - Unauthorized Bus Enumeration:\nGET /busesAll\n\nIDOR #2 - Unauthorized Bus Addition:\nPOST /busesAdd/123/anyAuthKey\nBody: {\n  \"busType\": \"AC\",\n  \"busNo\": 1234,\n  \"capacity\": 40\n}\n\nThis adds a bus to travel agency ID 123 without verifying the user has rights to that agency.",    "confidence_score": 8,    "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR"],    "context_code": [{        "name": "BusServiceImpl",        "reason": "Need to examine the implementation of authorization checks for the authKey parameter and travelId validation",        "code_line": "@Autowired private BusService bService;"    }]}
