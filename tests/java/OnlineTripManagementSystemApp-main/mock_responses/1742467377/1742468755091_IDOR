Analyzing Bus.java: Entity model with ID and relationships. 2.Examining BusController: Two endpoints - /busesAll (GET) and /busesAdd/{travelId}/{authKey} (POST). No authentication checks visible. 3.Looking at Travel.java: Shows relationship mapping between Bus and Travel entities. 4.Analyzing BusService interface: Methods for adding bus and getting all buses. 5.Missing BusServiceImpl which would contain actual authorization logic. Need to request it. 6.IDOR vulnerability clear in /busesAll - no auth check. 7.Potential IDOR in /busesAdd with travelId parameter. 8.Need BusServiceImpl to confirm authorization implementation and verify IDOR exists.",    "analysis": "Two potential IDOR vulnerabilities identified: 1) The /busesAll endpoint exposes all bus records across all agencies with no authentication or authorization checks. Any unauthenticated user can access sensitive business data from all travel agencies. 2) The /busesAdd/{travelId}/{authKey} endpoint accepts a travelId parameter that could potentially be manipulated to add buses to any agency's account. While it includes an authKey parameter, we need to see BusServiceImpl to confirm proper authorization checks. The integer-based ID system makes it trivial to enumerate other agencies' records.",    "poc": "1. GET /busesAll - Direct access reveals all bus records without authentication. 2. POST /busesAdd/123/any-auth-key with bus JSON payload - Potential unauthorized addition of bus to agency ID 123 if authKey validation is weak/missing in BusServiceImpl.",    "confidence_score": 7,    "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "BusServiceImpl",            "reason": "Need to verify authorization implementation for bus operations and confirm IDOR vulnerability",            "code_line": "private BusService bService;"        }    ]}
