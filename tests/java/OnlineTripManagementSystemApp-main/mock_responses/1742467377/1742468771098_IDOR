Analyzing Bus model and related controller/service classes. 2.Found /busesAll endpoint that returns all buses without auth. 3.Found /busesAdd/{travelId}/{authKey} endpoint that allows adding buses. 4.Need BusServiceImpl to confirm auth checks. 5.Currently have high-level classes but missing core implementation details. 6.Can confirm IDOR risk from exposed IDs and lack of visible auth checks. 7.Need to see actual implementation to verify auth bypass potential.",    "analysis": "Analysis reveals two potential IDOR vulnerabilities in the bus management endpoints. The first vulnerability exists in /busesAll which returns all bus records with no authentication. The second vulnerability is in /busesAdd/{travelId}/{authKey} where the travelId parameter could be manipulated. While an authKey is present, without seeing the BusServiceImpl code, we cannot confirm if proper authorization checks exist. The Bus and Travel models use auto-generated integer IDs (busId, travelId) which are easily enumerable. The @CrossOrigin(origins = '*') annotation also allows access from any domain, increasing the attack surface.",    "poc": "1. /busesAll IDOR: Send GET request to /busesAll to retrieve all bus records without authentication. 2. /busesAdd IDOR: Send POST request to /busesAdd/123/somekey with bus details in request body to potentially add bus to another agency's account. Enumerate different travelId values to access other agencies.",    "confidence_score": 7,    "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "BusServiceImpl",            "reason": "Need to see implementation of addBus() and getAllBusFromAllAgency() to confirm authentication/authorization checks",              "code_line": "@Autowired private BusService bService;"        }    ]}
