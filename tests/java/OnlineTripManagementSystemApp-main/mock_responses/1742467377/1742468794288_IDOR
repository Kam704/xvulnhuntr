This is an entity class for Travel model with JPA/Hibernate annotations. 2.Primary focus on IDOR potential since Travel objects contain IDs and sensitive data like contact info. 3.Class uses @Entity annotation indicating it is persisted to database. 4.Has travelId as primary key with auto generation. 5.Contains fields for sensitive data like agentName, contact details, and address. 6.Has OneToMany relationship with Bus entities. 7.Need to examine controller layer to see how Travel objects are fetched/accessed via API. 8.Need to check if proper authorization exists when fetching Travel objects by ID.",    "analysis": "The Travel entity class exposes potentially sensitive business data like travel agent details and contact information. While the model itself does not contain vulnerabilities, it could be vulnerable to IDOR attacks depending on how it is exposed via API endpoints. The use of an auto-generated integer ID (travelId) as the primary key makes it especially susceptible to enumeration attacks if proper authorization is not implemented at the controller layer. Need to examine TravelController and related service classes to determine if proper access controls exist when fetching Travel objects by ID.",    "poc": "More context needed from controller layer to construct PoC. Basic IDOR attack pattern would be: 1. Authenticate as regular user 2. Access /api/travels/1 (or similar endpoint) 3. Increment ID numbers to access unauthorized travel records",    "confidence_score": 3,    "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "TravelController",            "reason": "Need to examine API endpoints and authorization controls for Travel entity access",            "code_line": "@Entity @Table(name=\"Travels\")"        },        {            "name": "TravelService",            "reason": "Need to check service layer authorization logic for Travel operations",             "code_line": "@Entity @Table(name=\"Travels\")"        }    ]}
