Analyzed Travel entity model: Contains sensitive data fields like agentName, contact info, address. Uses auto-generated integer ID. 2.Reviewed TravelController endpoints: /travelsSearch/{travelId} allows direct access by ID without auth, /travelsList exposes all records. 3.Examined authorization: Only write operations require auth key, no auth checks on GET endpoints. 4.Mapped data access flows: GET endpoints allow unauthenticated direct object access via integer ID, no role/permission checks. 5.Identified IDOR vulnerability: Can enumerate and access any Travel record via incremental ID values. 6.Need to check TravelServiceImpl to confirm lack of authorization in implementation. 7.Found auth bypass: GET endpoints fully expose Travel records without any access control.",    "analysis": "The TravelController exposes an IDOR vulnerability through two unauthenticated GET endpoints: /travelsSearch/{travelId} and /travelsList. While POST/PUT/DELETE operations require an auth key parameter, the GET endpoints allow direct access to Travel records without any authentication or authorization checks. The use of sequential integer IDs (travelId) combined with no access controls makes it trivial to enumerate and access all Travel records containing sensitive business data like agent details and contact information. This is particularly concerning since the Travel entity contains private business information that should likely have restricted access.",    "poc": "1. Enumerate Travel records via GET /travelsSearch/{id}: for id in range(1,100): curl http://host:8888/travelsSearch/{id} 2. Mass harvest all records: curl http://host:8888/travelsList 3.
