Examining TravelController which exposes REST endpoints for Travel CRUD operations. 2.Two GET endpoints /travelsSearch/{travelId} and /travelsList are unauthenticated. 3.Analyzing Travel model shows sensitive fields like agentName, contact info, and address exposed through these endpoints. 4.Need to examine TravelServiceImpl to confirm lack of authorization checks. 5.Checking auth flow - while POST/PUT/DELETE require auth key, GET methods have no authorization. 6.Looking for sequential integer ID pattern - confirmed via @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO) in Travel model. 7.Analyzing potential attack vectors via ID enumeration due to predictable identifiers.",    "analysis": "The Travel management API exhibits an IDOR vulnerability through unauthenticated GET endpoints that expose sensitive business data. The Travel model contains private fields like agentName, contact details and address information that are accessible without authentication via /travelsSearch/{travelId} and /travelsList endpoints. The use of auto-incrementing integer IDs makes it trivial to enumerate all records. While other operations require an auth key parameter, these GET endpoints skip access controls entirely. The vulnerability is confirmed by tracing the full request path from the @GetMapping annotations in TravelController through to the Travel entity exposure.",    "poc": "1. Enumerate Travel records via GET /travelsSearch/{id} where id=1,2,3... 2. Example curl command: for i in $(seq 1 100); do curl -s http://host:8888/travelsSearch/$i; done 3.
