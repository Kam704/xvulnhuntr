Analyzed Travel model class - Contains sensitive fields like agentName,contact details,address. 2.Reviewed TravelController endpoints: - GET /travelsSearch/{travelId} and /travelsList don't require authentication - POST,PUT,DELETE operations require 'key' parameter for auth. 3.Examined TravelService and interface - No built-in access controls or authorization checks. 4.Need to see implementation of TravelServiceImpl to confirm auth validation. 5.Critical IDOR observations: - Auto-incrementing integer IDs (@GeneratedValue AUTO) makes enumeration trivial - No authentication required for GET endpoints - Sensitive business data exposed without authorization.",    "analysis": "The Travel management API contains a confirmed IDOR vulnerability in its GET endpoints that expose sensitive business information. The vulnerability stems from two key issues: 1) The Travel entity uses predictable auto-incrementing integer IDs that are easily enumerable 2) The /travelsSearch/{travelId} and /travelsList endpoints in TravelController expose full Travel objects including private fields without any authentication or authorization checks. While other operations (POST/PUT/DELETE) require an auth key parameter, these GET endpoints completely bypass access controls. An attacker can simply iterate through travel IDs to access sensitive agent information, contact details and address data for all travel records in the system.",    "poc": "1.
