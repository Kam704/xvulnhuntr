Examining the codebase for remotely exploitable IDOR vulnerabilities. 2.The Travel entity uses auto-incrementing integer IDs with @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO). 3.TravelController exposes /travelsSearch/{travelId} and /travelsList endpoints that return full Travel objects. 4.Need to check TravelServiceImpl to understand authorization implementation since service interface and implementation are crucial for understanding if IDOR exists. 5.TravelController has authentication requirements via 'key' parameter for write operations (POST/PUT/DELETE) but GET operations have no auth. 6.Travel object contains sensitive fields like agentName, contact details and address that should not be publicly exposed.",        "analysis": "After reviewing the code, I confirm a critical IDOR vulnerability exists in the Travel management API. The vulnerability stems from unauthenticated access to sensitive business data through the GET endpoints. Specifically: 1) The Travel entity uses auto-incrementing integer IDs (@GeneratedValue) which are predictable and enumerable 2) The /travelsSearch/{travelId} and /travelsList endpoints in TravelController expose complete Travel objects containing sensitive business data with no authentication or authorization checks 3) While write operations (POST/PUT/DELETE) require an auth key parameter, the GET endpoints bypass all access controls 4) The exposed data includes sensitive business fields like agentName, contact details and embedded Address objects 5) An attacker can trivially enumerate travelIds to harvest competitive business intelligence.",    "poc": "1. Identify travel IDs by starting at travelId=1 and incrementing: curl -X GET http://target:8888/travelsSearch/1 2. Extract sensitive business data from response JSON, including agentName, contact and address details 3. Automate harvesting by iterating through IDs: for i in {1..1000}; do curl -X GET http://target:8888/travelsSearch/$i; done 4. Alternatively, get complete dataset in one request: curl -X GET http://target:8888/travelsList",    "confidence_score": 10,    "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR"],    "context_code": [{        "name": "TravelServiceImpl",        "reason": "Need to verify if any authorization checks exist in service layer implementation",        "code_line": "Travel travels = tService.serchTravels(travelId);"    }]}
