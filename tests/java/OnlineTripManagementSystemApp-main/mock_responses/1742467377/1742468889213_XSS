Reviewing Travel.java: Found fields that store user input (travelName, agentName). 2.Analyzing TravelController.java: Identified REST endpoints exposing Travel data. No obvious output encoding/escaping. 3.Looking at service layer: Interface only defines CRUD operations. 4.Tracing user input: @RequestBody Travel objects in POST/PUT endpoints allow direct control of Travel fields. 5.Need to see how Travel objects are rendered/serialized to responses. 6.Need validation/sanitization implementations. 7.Cross-referencing with example bypasses - potential for injection into Travel fields that get reflected back.",    "analysis": "Based on the code review, there are potential XSS vectors through the Travel entity fields that receive untrusted input via REST endpoints. The TravelController exposes POST/PUT endpoints that accept Travel objects with user-controlled fields like travelName and agentName. These fields are then stored and reflected back in GET responses. No visible input sanitization or output encoding is implemented in the controller or interface layers. However, we need to see the actual service implementation and response serialization to confirm exploitability. The vulnerability might allow stored XSS if malicious script content can be injected into these fields and is later rendered in a frontend view.",    "poc": "POST /travels/key\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  'travelName': '<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>',\n  'agentName': 'javascript:alert(1)'\n}\n\nThen retrieve via: GET /travelsSearch/{id}",    "confidence_score": 6,    "vulnerability_types": ["XSS"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "TravelServiceImpl",            "reason": "Need to see validation/sanitization implementation for Travel fields",            "code_line": "@Autowired private TravelService tService;"        },        {            "name": "TravelSerializer",             "reason": "Need to understand how Travel objects are serialized to responses",            "code_line": "return new ResponseEntity<>(travels, HttpStatus.CREATED);"        }    ]}
