Code Review: Analyzing Travel.java, TravelController.java, and TravelService.java for XSS vulnerabilities. Found public APIs accepting Travel objects with unsanitized String fields. 2.Attack Surface: TravelController exposes POST/PUT endpoints accepting Travel objects. Fields travelName and agentName are String type without validation. 3.Data Flow: External input via REST endpoints -> Travel object fields -> Response serialization. 4.Missing Context: Need to see TravelServiceImpl to check for any sanitization, and need serializer implementation to verify how data is encoded in responses. 5.Known Issues: No input validation annotations on string fields, @CrossOrigin allows all origins (*). 6.Need to verify: Response Content-Type headers, serialization encoding, any HTML escaping.",    "analysis": "Based on the available code, there are potential stored XSS vulnerabilities in the Travel entity's travelName and agentName String fields. The TravelController exposes these fields via REST endpoints with no visible input validation or sanitization. The @CrossOrigin(origins = '*') annotation increases risk by allowing requests from any origin. However, complete confirmation of exploitability requires seeing the service implementation and serialization code to verify lack of output encoding. The current evidence suggests stored XSS risk but requires additional context.",    "poc": "POST /travels/{key}\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  'travelName': '<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>',\n  'agentName': '<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>'\n}\n\nThen retrieve via GET /travelsSearch/{id}",    "confidence_score": 6,    "vulnerability_types": ["XSS"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "TravelServiceImpl",            "reason": "Need to verify if any input sanitization is performed in service layer",            "code_line": "@Autowired private TravelService tService;"        },        {            "name": "TravelSerializer",            "reason": "Need to check response serialization encoding/escaping",            "code_line": "return new ResponseEntity<>(travels, HttpStatus.CREATED);"        }    ]}
