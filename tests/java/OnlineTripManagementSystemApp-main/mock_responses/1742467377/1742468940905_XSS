Analyzed Travel.java model showing string fields travelName and agentName that could be XSS vectors if not properly sanitized 2.Examined TravelController showing REST endpoints with @CrossOrigin('*') and handling of Travel object data 3.Checked TravelService interface showing methods but need implementation details 4.Need to see implementation of TravelServiceImpl to check for any sanitization 5.Also need to check how Travel objects are serialized to responses 6.Current visibility: input handling via REST endpoints -> Travel model -> Service interface but missing serialization and service implementation 7.High XSS risk due to: unrestricted CORS, string fields exposed via REST, no visible sanitization 8.But cannot confirm full exploit chain without seeing how data is processed and serialized",    "analysis": "Based on the available code, there are potential stored XSS vulnerabilities in the Travel entity's travelName and agentName fields that are exposed via REST endpoints. The @CrossOrigin('*') annotation allows requests from any origin, increasing risk. However, to confirm exploitability and provide a complete attack chain, we need to see the service implementation and serialization code to verify lack of sanitization and understand how the data is ultimately rendered.
