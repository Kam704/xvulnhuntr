The code implements travel services with REST-like endpoints for managing travel agencies and bus details. 2.The key methods handle adding/updating/removing travel agencies and buses, with admin-only access. 3.Authentication is done via authKey tokens. 4.Initial vulnerability scan reveals potential IDOR in serchTravels() and viewTravels() methods which lack authentication. 5.Need to analyze input validation on Travel and Bus objects in addTravels() and updateTravels(). 6.Request additional context for API controller layer to confirm remote accessibility and input handling. 7.Request Travel and Bus model classes to analyze object validation.",        "analysis": "The code reveals two key potential vulnerabilities: 1) The serchTravels() and viewTravels() methods allow unauthenticated access to Travel records, enabling IDOR attacks to enumerate or access any travel agency details by ID. 2) The addTravels() and updateTravels() methods process Travel and Bus objects from untrusted input without apparent validation, requiring inspection of model classes to confirm security controls. While authentication exists for admin operations, the public search endpoints create an IDOR risk. Need controller layer code to confirm these are externally accessible REST endpoints.",    "poc": "IDOR PoC for serchTravels: Send sequential GET requests with incrementing travelId values to /api/travels/{id} to enumerate all travel agencies without authentication.
