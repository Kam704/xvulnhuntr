Analyzing TravelServiceImplementation.java for IDOR vulnerabilities focusing on object reference checks. 2.Found serchTravels(Integer travelId) method lacks any authorization check - allows direct access to travel info by ID. 3.viewTravels() also lacks auth checks for listing all travels. 4.Need to examine TravelRepository and Travel model to understand data exposure. 5.Need to see the controller layer to confirm these methods are exposed via API endpoints. 6.removeTravels() and updateTravels() have admin role checks but potential IDOR in object lookup. 7.Request additional context to confirm attack surface.",    "analysis": "The code contains several potential IDOR vulnerabilities stemming from insufficient authorization checks. The most severe issue is in serchTravels() which takes a travelId parameter and returns Travel object details without any authentication or authorization verification. This allows any user to access any travel agency's data by simply knowing or guessing the ID. viewTravels() has a similar issue exposing all travel records. While updateTravels() and removeTravels() do check for admin role, they still allow admins to access any travel record without verifying ownership or proper access rights.",    "poc": "1. Identify the API endpoint exposing serchTravels() (likely /api/travels/{id} or similar) 2. Make unauthenticated GET request to endpoint with incremental travelIds: GET /api/travels/1, GET /api/travels/2, etc 3. Successfully retrieve sensitive travel agency information without authorization",    "confidence_score": 7,    "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "Travel",            "reason": "Need to examine Travel model to understand exposed data sensitivity",            "code_line": "Optional<Travel> opt=tDao.findById(travelId);"        },        {            "name": "TravelController",            "reason": "Need to verify API exposure of vulnerable methods",            "code_line": "public class TravelServiceImplementation implements TravelService{"        }    ]}
