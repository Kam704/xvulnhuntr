Examined TravelController and TravelServiceImplementation classes. 2.Identified unauthenticated endpoints: /travelsSearch/{travelId} and /travelsList. 3.Traced serchTravels() and viewTravels() methods - no authentication or authorization checks. 4.Found critical IDOR vulnerabilities allowing unauthorized access to travel agency data. 5.Validated updateTravels() and removeTravels() have basic admin role check but no ownership verification. 6.Confirmed complete code path from controller to service layer.",    "analysis": "The code contains critical IDOR vulnerabilities in two main areas: 1. Unauthenticated access to travel records: The serchTravels() and viewTravels() methods in TravelServiceImplementation expose sensitive travel agency data without any authentication or authorization checks. These methods are accessible via /travelsSearch/{travelId} and /travelsList endpoints. 2. Inadequate authorization for admin operations: While updateTravels() and removeTravels() verify admin role, they lack proper ownership validation allowing admins to modify any travel record. The authorization model is insufficient as it only checks user type without verifying legitimate access rights to specific travel records.",    "poc": "1. Exploit unauthenticated access:\nGET /travelsSearch/1 - Retrieves full travel agency details for ID 1\nGET /travelsSearch/2 - Retrieves another agency's details\nGET /travelsList - Retrieves all travel agency records\n\n2. Exploit admin IDOR:\n- Login as admin to get auth key\n- PUT /travelsUpdate/{auth_key}\nBody: {\"travelId\": 1, ...} - Modify any travel record by ID\n- DELETE /travelsDelete/1/{auth_key} - Delete any travel record by ID",    "confidence_score": 10,    "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR"],    "context_code": []}
