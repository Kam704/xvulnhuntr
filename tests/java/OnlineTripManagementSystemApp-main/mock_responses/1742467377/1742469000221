Analyzing SwaggerConfig.java which configures Swagger documentation for the API. 2.The code exposes API documentation through Swagger UI. 3. Swagger configuration allows any path and any API handler through PathSelectors.any() and RequestHandlerSelectors.any(). 4. This means all endpoints will be exposed in the documentation, even those that should potentially be hidden. 5. The configuration lacks authentication/authorization controls for accessing the Swagger UI. 6. Need to examine how authentication is implemented and what endpoints are exposed. 7. Requesting ApiSecurityConfig and related authentication classes to understand security controls. 8. Also need to see what controllers are exposed to understand the attack surface.",    "analysis": "The SwaggerConfig.java file exposes potential security concerns by allowing unrestricted access to API documentation and enabling documentation for all endpoints via .any() selectors. Without proper authentication controls on the Swagger UI interface, this could lead to information disclosure about internal API endpoints and data structures that an attacker could leverage. The current configuration may expose sensitive endpoint information that should be restricted. To complete the security analysis, we need to examine the authentication configuration and exposed controllers.",    "poc": "1. Access http://server:8888/swagger-ui/ to view complete API documentation\n2. Enumerate all available endpoints and their parameters\n3. Look for sensitive endpoints that should be restricted\n4.
