Analyzing SwaggerConfig.java for IDOR vulnerabilities. 2.The configuration enables Swagger UI documentation with full access to all API endpoints via .apis(RequestHandlerSelectors.any()) and .paths(PathSelectors.any()). 3.This exposes all API endpoints and their parameters in the Swagger UI, which could reveal potential IDOR vulnerabilities. 4.Need to examine the actual API endpoint implementations and authorization checks. 5.Requesting Controllers and Service layers to analyze authorization mechanisms and ID-based resource access patterns.",    "analysis": "The SwaggerConfig.java file exposes complete API documentation through Swagger UI by allowing access to all API endpoints (.apis(RequestHandlerSelectors.any())) and all paths (.paths(PathSelectors.any())). While this alone is not an IDOR vulnerability, it potentially aids attackers by providing detailed API documentation including endpoint paths, parameters, and response models that could be used to identify and exploit IDOR vulnerabilities. However, to confirm actual IDOR vulnerabilities, we need to examine the API controllers and service layers where object references are processed.",    "poc": "None",    "confidence_score": 3,    "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "UserController",            "reason": "Need to examine user-related endpoints for potential IDOR in user profile/data access",            "code_line": ".apis(RequestHandlerSelectors.any())"        },        {            "name": "BookingController",            "reason": "Need to examine booking-related endpoints for potential IDOR in booking access/modification",            "code_line": ".apis(RequestHandlerSelectors.any())"        },        {            "name": "SecurityConfig",            "reason": "Need to examine authorization configuration and access control mechanisms",            "code_line": ".apis(RequestHandlerSelectors.any())"        }    ]}
