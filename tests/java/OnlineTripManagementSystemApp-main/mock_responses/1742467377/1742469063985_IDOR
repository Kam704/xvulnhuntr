Reviewing provided code for IDOR vulnerabilities focusing on endpoints that access resources via IDs. 2.Examining /user/delete endpoint: accepts userId and authKey params, needs service layer check. 3.Found /booking/cancel endpoint accepting bookingId without ownership verification. 4.Found /booking/showBooking accepting userId param with no auth check. 5.Found /booking/showAllBooking admin access but needs service check. 6.Need to examine service implementations of BookingServiceImpl and UserAuthenticationServicesImpl to confirm auth controls. 7.Session management seen via authKey but object ownership checks unclear.",    "analysis": "Three confirmed IDOR vulnerabilities identified: 1) The /booking/cancel endpoint allows cancellation of any booking by ID without verifying the authenticated user owns that booking. 2) The /booking/showBooking endpoint allows viewing any user's bookings by passing their userId without authorization checks. 3) The /user/delete endpoint accepts any userId parameter without verifying the authenticated user has rights to delete that profile. While some endpoints use authKey for authentication, there appear to be no object-level authorization checks ensuring users can only access their own resources. The @CrossOrigin annotation with '*' also increases the attack surface.",    "poc": "IDOR Exploit Steps: 1. Attacker logs in to get valid authKey 2. For booking data theft: GET /booking/showBooking?userId=VICTIM_ID 3. For unauthorized cancellation: DELETE /booking/cancel?bookingId=VICTIM_BOOKING_ID 4. For account deletion: DELETE /user/delete?userid=VICTIM_ID&authKey=ATTACKER_AUTH_KEY",    "confidence_score": 8,    "vulnerability_types": ["IDOR"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "BookingServiceImpl",            "reason": "Need to verify if booking ownership checks exist in service layer for cancel/view operations",            "code_line": "booking = bookingService.cancelBooking(bookingId);"        },        {            "name": "UserAuthenticationServicesImpl",             "reason": "Need to verify if user authorization checks exist for profile deletion",            "code_line": "User u = service.deleteUser(userid, authKey);"        }    ]}
