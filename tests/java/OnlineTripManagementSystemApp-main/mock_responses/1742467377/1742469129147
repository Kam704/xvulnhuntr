Analyzing GlobalExceptionHandler.java - This is a central exception handling class using @ControllerAdvice, indicating it handles exceptions across the application. 2.Identified potential XSS vulnerability - The error messages and descriptions from exceptions are returned directly to the client without sanitization in ErrorDetails objects. 3.Lack of proper exception message sanitization in multiple handlers. 4.Need to see ErrorDetails class implementation to confirm if there's any output encoding. 5.Need to see sample controller classes to understand input validation and processing. 6.Exception messages could potentially contain sensitive data that gets reflected back. 7.WebRequest.getDescription() output is included directly in responses.",        "analysis": "The GlobalExceptionHandler class demonstrates potential XSS vulnerabilities through unsanitized error message reflection. The class catches various exceptions and returns their messages directly to clients via ErrorDetails objects. Error messages and request descriptions are included verbatim in responses without apparent sanitization. This could enable XSS if attackers can inject malicious content that gets included in exception messages. While this is a potential vulnerability, we need to see the ErrorDetails class implementation and sample controllers to fully confirm the attack path and determine if there's any output encoding happening elsewhere.",        "poc": "To exploit potential XSS: 1. Send malicious input to an endpoint that causes an exception. 2. If the input is included in the exception message, it will be reflected back in the ErrorDetails response. Example payload: Send request with parameter containing: '<script>alert(1)</script>' that triggers an exception. The payload would be included in the response if no sanitization exists.",        "confidence_score": 5,        "vulnerability_types": ["XSS"],        "context_code": [        {            "name": "ErrorDetails",            "reason": "Need to examine if any output encoding is implemented in the ErrorDetails class",            "code_line": "ErrorDetails authEx = new ErrorDetails();"        },        {            "name": "UserController",            "reason": "Need to see how user input is processed and validated before potentially causing exceptions",            "code_line": "@ExceptionHandler(UserAlreadyExistsException.class)"        },        {            "name": "AuthenticationController",            "reason": "Need to examine authentication logic that could trigger InvalidCredentialException",            "code_line": "@ExceptionHandler(InvalidCredentialException.class)"        }    ]}
