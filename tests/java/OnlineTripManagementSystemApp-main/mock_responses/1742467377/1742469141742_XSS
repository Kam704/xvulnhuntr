Analyzing GlobalExceptionHandler.java exception handlers. Each handler takes in an Exception object and WebRequest object and returns an ErrorDetails response. 2.The ErrorDetails response includes timestamp, message and description that are set from user input (exception message and web request). 3.Most critical is that WebRequest.getDescription() output and exception messages are directly included in response without sanitization. 4.Need to analyze ErrorDetails class to see how response is rendered. 5.Need to check if Spring's ResponseEntity properly escapes content - often it uses Content-Type application/json which helps mitigate XSS but depends on client processing. 6.Looking at error descriptions - would the raw WebRequest description or exception message be rendered as HTML by the client?",        "analysis": "The GlobalExceptionHandler acts as a central exception handling component using Spring's @ControllerAdvice annotation. It catches various exceptions and returns ErrorDetails objects wrapped in ResponseEntity. The key issue is that it takes untrusted user input via exception messages and web request descriptions and includes them directly in the response without sanitization. While Spring's ResponseEntity typically sends responses with application/json Content-Type which provides some XSS protection, this depends entirely on client-side processing. If the client renders the error messages as HTML or injects them into the DOM, there is potential for XSS. However, I need to see the ErrorDetails class implementation and client-side error handling to confirm exploitation. Additionally, need to verify if custom exception messages can be manipulated by user input.",    "poc": "None",    "confidence_score": 5,    "vulnerability_types": ["XSS"],    "context_code": [        {            "name": "ErrorDetails",            "reason": "Need to see how error messages are formatted and if any sanitization is applied",            "code_line": "ErrorDetails authEx = new ErrorDetails();"        }    ]}
