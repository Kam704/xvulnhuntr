The key vulnerability paths are: 1) Exception messages that can be user-influenced through crafted malicious inputs, and 2) WebRequest.getDescription() which contains user-controlled request data. However, successful exploitation depends on how clients process and render these error responses, since Spring's ResponseEntity typically sends JSON. The risk increases if client JavaScript extracts these messages and injects them into the DOM without proper HTML escaping. A secondary concern is that detailed error messages containing potentially sensitive information are being exposed to clients.",    "poc": "1.
